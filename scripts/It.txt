INT. BILL’S BEDROOM - DAY
A little boy gazes out into the storm. Nervous, eager, sweet. 
GEORGIE DENBROUGH (7).
                        GEORGE
            Sure I won’t get in trouble, Bill?
BILL (13), his brother, sits up in bed, surrounded by tissues 
and sheets of newspaper. Finishing creases on a PAPER BOAT.
                        BILL
            Don’t be a wuss. I’d come with you 
            if I weren’t (cough) dying.
                        GEORGE
            You’re not dying. 
                        BILL
            You didn’t see the vomit coming out 
            of my nose this morning.
He throws a Kleenex at Georgie.
                        BILL (CONT’D)
            Now g-g-go on, get the wax.
                        GEORGE
            In the cellar?
                        BILL
            You want it to float don’t you?
Georgie. Hesitant. Scared, even. Resigned, he looks over at 
the WALKIE TALKIES laying on the shelf. Grabs one and goes.
                                                           CUT TO:
TITLE CARD: 
       OCTOBER 1988
                                                                  2.

INT. BILL’S HOUSE - DAY
Georgie hurries downstairs, catching a glimpse of their 
mother SHARON DENBROUGH (30s) in the parlor playing piano, an 
earthy beauty transported to another world while she plays.

INT. KITCHEN - BILL’S HOUSE - DAY
George’s stomach sinks as he comes face to face with THE 
CELLAR DOOR -- the only thing between George and the monster 
in the basement of his imagination.

INT. CELLAR DOORWAY - CONTINUOUS
Flinging the door open, George ventures his arm into the DARK 
VOID. He gropes around and finds the LIGHT SWITCH. Nothing. 
George snatches his arm back. The dark basement glares back 
at him, taunting. One... Two... 
Walkie CRACKLES. Georgie jumps, startled. 
                        BILL
                (over walkie)
            C’mon! H-Hurry up!
Recovering, Georgie scrambles down the steps to THE CELLAR 
SHELF. Sifts through junk as fast as he can: a BROKEN 
FLASHLIGHT, TURTLE WAX, a bag of colored BALLOONS.  
He grabs the BOX OF PARAFFIN near the back of the shelf, and 
hurries back up the stairs as we quickly track towards him, 
about to pounce. The door slams in our face.

INT. BILL’S BEDROOM - DAY
Bill melts a chunk of paraffin with a match in a ceramic 
bowl, then dips his finger into the hot liquid and smears the 
wax along the sides of the boat.
                        BILL
            There you go. She’s all ready, 
            Captain.
They both grin, the cozy room full of cheerful brotherly 
love. George kisses Bill on the cheek, startling him.
                        GEORGIE
            Thanks, Billy.
                                                                  3.

                        BILL
            D-Don’t forget to put on all your 
            rain stuff before you go out or 
            mom’ll blow a circuit.
He goes. Bill looks to the rain-lashed window, piano still 
playing. He’s suddenly filled with a sense of foreboding.

EXT. BILL DENBROUGH’S HOUSE - DAY 
Holding his boat, George exits through the Front Door. Once 
more, the Walkie in his Slicker’s Pocket CRACKLES to life -- 
                        WILL
                (through Walkie)
            Be careful. 
George stops and looks up at his Brother in the window 
looking down on him. Georgie gives a little wave. 

EXT. WITCHAM STREET - LATER 
A DEAD TRAFFIC LIGHT sways overhead, its black lenses gazing 
back at A BOY IN A YELLOW SLICKER AND RED GALOSHES. 
George races down the street past dark houses after his PAPER 
BOAT, which sluices along a gutter swollen with rushing 
rainwater toward the intersection.
Angle on the dripping street signs: WITCHAM & JACKSON.
Rain taps on George’s hood sounding to his ears like rain on 
a shed roof, a comforting almost cozy sound. The buckles of 
his galoshes make a merry jingle as he goes.
The boat whistles past a blockade of sawhorses marked DEPT OF 
DERRY PUBLIC WORKS. Georgie ducks under one to keep up with 
his boat. Continues to run, head down until --  
SMACK! He runs right into one of those sawhorses, cutting off  
his path. Georgie falls back while the Boat sails on. 
                        GEORGE
            No!
George gets back to his feet. Chases after his paper boat, 
reaching it just as it surfs up to the drain, circles around 
twice, and is swallowed up. George looks ready to cry.
                        GEORGE (CONT’D)
            Oh, Bill’s gonna kill me.
                                                                  4.

He peers into the storm drain, water falling into darkness.  
A dank hollow sound comes from within, the boat kicking in 
and out of the shadows. 
George snakes his arm through the grate, reaching for the 
boat, his nose pressed against the curb. Just as he’s about 
to get it a face appears.
A GREASY WHITE FACE
George recoils from the storm drain, spooked. That’s when a 
VOICE, a sad voice, rises up.
                        PENNYWISE 
            This your boat?
George looks around, hoping someone else is around to hear 
this. It’s just him and the torrential rain. An OLD WOMAN 
watches from the window of a house behind the storm drain.
CUT TO:  
POV from the OLD WOMAN’s house. She turns her attention back 
to her cat, scraping out the wet innards of a can of tuna 
into a plate on the window sill. It meows.
BACK TO GEORGIE: 
                        PENNYWISE (CONT’D)
            It’s a nice boat. Floats.
George looks back at the drain. Deep inside there, lingering 
just on the edge of the shadows...
IS A CLOWN
Not Bozo, or Ronald McDonald, but something more old world, 
freakish, like that of a 19th-century acrobat -- bald, lithe, 
almost child-like. PENNYWISE.
                        GEORGE
            Why are you in the sewer? 
                        PENNYWISE
            Oh, the circus said not to say. 
                        GEORGE
            How come? 
                        PENNYWISE
            They don’t let me in on that stuff. 
            I just do my tricks for the kids. 
            You look like a nice boy. I’ll bet 
            you have a lot of friends. 
                                                                  5.

                        GEORGE
            Three. But my brother is my best 
            best... 
George glances at the paper boat, now kicking between 
Pennywise’s gnarly white feet. Pennywise picks up the boat.
                        PENNYWISE
            Your best best. Is this his boat? 
                        GEORGE
            He made it for me. 
A big grin swells across Pennywise’s face. 
                        PENNYWISE
            That’s a good brother. Where is he?
                        GEORGE
            In bed. Sick.
                        PENNYWISE
            Let me cheer him up. I’ll bring you 
            both to the circus. 
                        GEORGE 
            He won’t want to go. 
                        PENNYWISE
            Why not? There’s cotton candy and 
            bearded women and all the balloons 
            your brother could want. 
                        GEORGE
            He’s 13. He thinks balloons are 
            dumb. And clowns are dumb. 
Pennywise’s face turns, a dawning awareness. 
                        PENNYWISE
            Well you don’t do you? 
George shrugs. 
                        PENNYWISE (CONT’D)
            I’ll take just you then. 
                        GEORGE
            I don’t know. I’m not supposed to 
            talk to strangers.
                                                                  6.

                        PENNYWISE
            Smart parents, smart parents. Well 
            I’m Bob Gray. Pennywise to my 
            friends. What do they call you?
                        GEORGE
            G-Georgie.
                        PENNYWISE
            Georgie. Now we aren’t strangers, 
            are we?
George shrugs, still not convinced. 
                        PENNYWISE (CONT’D)
            I promise I’ll have you back in 
            time for dinner. Give me your hand, 
            we’ll shake on it. 
                        GEORGE
            You’re still a stranger. I don’t 
            want to talk to you.
                        PENNYWISE
            Okay, shake and give me the silent 
            treatment. Zip your lip up and 
            shake -- 
With his left hand Pennywise pretends to zip his own lip 
while offering his right through the sewer drain. 
                        PENNYWISE (CONT’D)
            -- and I’ll give you back your 
            boat. 
Pennywise holds Georgie’s boat out of the drain with his 
right hand. Georgie reaches out both hands, his left to 
receive his boat and his right for a handshake to signal 
their friendship. He gets ever closer when -- 
Pennywise lunges. Grabs Georgie’s hand. Jerks him down and 
toward the sewer, baring his mouthful of razor-like teeth. 
CUT TO the OLD WOMAN’s POV again.  
The cat devours its food, the old woman pleased with his 
appetite. She hears a scream and looks up, dropping the food 
and heading for her door as quickly as her old bones permit. 
BACK ON GEORGIE
On the ground. Crawling away from the drain. A gnawed and 
bloody stump where his right arm used to be seconds ago. 
                                                                  7.

But at least he’s getting awa--
YANK! Georgie is pulled back into the blackness of the Storm 
Drain. Screaming as loud as his little lungs can manage.
CUT TO the OLD WOMAN’S POV one last time. 
As she totters from her building, staring in terrified 
wonderment at the drain across the street which has swallowed 
Georgie Denbrough whole -- 
                                                    SMASH CUT TO:
TITLE CARD:
              JUNE 1989

EXT. DERRY - AERIAL - DAY 
In the distance, settled on a crosscut of the Penobscot River 
and Kenduskaeg Stream rests the TOWN OF DERRY, MAINE. 
TILT STRAIGHT DOWN to HANLON ABBATOIR 
SEVERAL multi-acre, manure filled sheep pens stand empty. One 
has 50 sheep ready for slaughter, a path leading from the pen 
grows narrower as it feeds into an industrial complex 
designed for slaughter. 
                                                           CUT TO:
A SHEEP. Big and bleating. Looking right at us. 
STUNBOLT GUN enters frame. Inches from the Sheep’s glabella. 
Also known as ‘that space between your eyes.’ 
It’s held there. For a squirm-in-your-seat amount of time. 
                        VOICE (O.S.)
            Pull it, son. 
That’s LEROY HANLON (60s). He looks much older though. 
Working every day of your life will do that to you. And he’s 
the Hanlon in --
HANLON ABBATOIR
It’s his grandson MIKE (13) that holds the Stunbolt Gun. 
Leroy describes Mike as ‘soft’. Because of reasons like this: 
                                                                  8.

                        VOICE/LEROY
            Go on now. Pull it. 
Mike’s hand shakes. Nerves getting to him. 
                        MIKE
            I don’t want to do this. 
                        LEROY
            People need to eat. 
                        MIKE
            But how would you feel? Raised for 
            food... 
                        LEROY
            Like I’d want you to get it over 
            with is how I’d feel... Remember 
            what I told you? You gotta do this 
            quick. If the animal senses what 
            you’re about to do, if it starts to 
            fear you, adrenaline courses 
            through its body and changes the 
            taste and the meat winds up tough.  
He snatches the Stunbolt away from Mike. And without a 
moments hesitation he squeezes the trigger and -- 
Whompf! The Sheep falls. Mike stares at its bleeding-out 
carcass as Leroy hangs the Stunbolt. 
                        LEROY (CONT’D)
            You need to start taking more 
            responsibility around here, Mike. 
            Your Dad was younger than you when 
            he took this over... 
                        MIKE
            But what if I can’t? What if I 
            don’t want to do this, be here... 
                        LEROY
            Look at me. Let me tell you about 
            being here. ‘Cuz you need to 
            understand something. There are two 
            places you can be in this world. 
            You can be out here, like us. Or 
            you can be in there, like them... 
Leroy points to the other Sheep. Lined up and waiting in the 
Slaughter Pen for their turn with the Stunbolt. 
                                                                  9.

                        LEROY (CONT’D)
            And if you waste too much time 
            hemming and hawing, that choice is 
            gonna be made for you. ‘Cept you 
            won’t know it til you feel the bolt 
            blast right between your eyes... 
INT. DERRY MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY
Doors fling open and ROWDY 6TH, 7TH, and 8TH GRADERS spill 
out into the halls like sheep. Books are hurled in the trash, 
lockers emptied out, papers strewn all over -- summer is 
officially commenced. Swept up among this madness is...
BILL DENBROUGH (13)
Handsome and gangly, a boy straight out of a Sally Mann 
photo, still haunted by the memory of his little brother. 
EDDIE KASPBRAK (13)
A boy abnormally small for his age, his INHALER holstered in 
his medicine-filled fannypack; 
RICHIE TOZIER (13) 
A video game and television freak with bug-eyed glasses; 
STANLEY URIS (13)
Tightly wound. Repressed. Anxious. Wears a kippah.
                        BILL
            How’s it work? 
                        EDDIE
            They slice part of his penis off. 
                        RICHIE
            That can’t be true. He’d have 
            nothing left... 
Eddie takes a puff off his INHALER. 
                        STANLEY
            That’s a real knee-slapper, Richie. 
            So funny I forgot to laugh... 
                        RICHIE
            So which is it? Knee-slapper or you 
            forgot to laugh? 
                        BILL
            For serious, Stan. Wh-what happens? 
                                                                 10.

                        STANLEY
            I don’t know, I read some stuff 
            from the Torah and make a speech 
            and then suddenly I become a man.
                        RICHIE
            That sounds like a lot of work. I 
            became a man by banging Ed’s mom... 
                        STANLEY
            Richie. Gross. 
They turn right toward the exit leading to endless summer but 
we push forward through the swarms of school kids and find -- 
TRAVIS BOWERS (16) and his thug sidekicks: BELCH HUGGINS 
(15), PATRICK HOCKSTETTLER (17) and VICTOR CRISS (15) -- one 
a lunkhead oaf, another a perpetually giggly fire-starting 
sociopath, and the last one a scrap and scab junk yard dog 
type. They nudge each other to look over at -- 
BEVERLY MARSH (13). Tossing a cloud of auburn hair away from 
her wary green-gray eyes. Proud but not conceited, she’s the 
envy and natural enemy to all popular girls.
Speaking of which -- 
A group of PRETTY POPULAR GIRLS, some in field hockey 
uniforms with pleated skirts they’ve rolled up extra short 
and carrying their sticks, join Travis and the others. 
The prettier leader, GRETTA (14), rolls her eyes as she sees 
who has their attention... 
                        GRETTA
            If I have to see that bitch one 
            more time this summer... 
A GIRL next to Gretta drops her backpack to her side and 
fishes out a field hockey ball from its front pocket.
                        GIRL #1
            I think I can handle this. 
Tee-ing up the ball she smacks it towards Beverly’s shins. 
Quick, a startled Beverly lifts one leg and the ball hits the 
lockers behind her with a loud CLANG.
                        GIRL #1 (CONT’D)
            Sure know how to spread ‘em, slut!
Peals of laughter from the group. 
                                                                  11.

 Beverly turns and darts down the hallways so they can’t see 
 the reddening of her face.
                         GRETTA
             Run, bitch!

 EXT. EMERGENCY EXIT - DERRY HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
 Pudgy BEN HASCOMB (13) lingers with his bike. He has 
headphones ON, connected to a Walkman. Doesn’t hear the door 
open behind him and Beverly step out. Ben blocks her way.
She taps him on the shoulder. Startled, he turns and rips off 
his headphones. Like he’s embarrassed. 
                        BEVERLY
            You gonna let me go by or is there 
            a secret password or something?
                        BEN
            Sorry.
He steps aside. But Beverly doesn’t move. Instead lights a 
cigarette like a pro. Exhales a long stream of smoke before -- 
                        BEVERLY
            “Sorry’s” not a password. Travis 
            and his goons are over by the west 
            entrance so you should be fine...
                        BEN
            I wasn’t... 
He was. 
                        BEVERLY
            What are you listening to? 
She grabs his headphones before Ben gets a chance to react. 
Which is a shame. Because as she puts ‘em on all we hear is --
I’ll be loving you forever... As long as you want me to be...
Ben. Red. Beverly. Surprised. 
                        BEVERLY (CONT’D)
            Wow. New Kids on the Block.  
                        BEN
            I don’t even like them. I was 
            just... y’know...  
                                                                 12.

                        BEVERLY
            Oh, wait. You’re the new kid, 
            right? Now I get it...  
                        BEN
            There’s nothing to get --  
                        BEVERLY
            It’s fine, really. I’m -- 
                        BEN
                (blurting)
            Beverly Marsh. 
A little too quick. His ears turn red with embarrassment.
                        BEN (CONT’D)
            I just know ‘cuz we were in social 
            studies. Together, in the same 
            class. You were... 
                (ugh, forget it)
            I’m Ben. But everyone pretty much 
            just calls me -- 
                        BEVERLY
            “The new kid.” 
                        BEN
            Even though I’ve been here four 
            months already... 
                        BEVERLY
            Well Ben, there are worse things to 
            be called...
Ben crushing on her. 
                        BEVERLY (CONT’D)
            Can I sign your yearbook? 
She doesn’t even wait for his answer and takes his YEARBOOK 
out of his hands. Opens it and sees she’s the first, and 
only, to sign it. Her heart breaks a little for him. She 
writes “Stay Cool” and signs her name with three hearts. 
Ben sees a FAINT YELLOW BRUISE on her forearm. Beverly 
notices him noticing.
                        BEVERLY (CONT’D)
            “Stay cool” Ben from sosh class. 
                        BEN
            Uh, you too, Beverly. 
                                                                 13.

Ben watches her go, totally smitten.
                        BEVERLY
            “K.I.T.”
Feeling brilliant for an instant--
                        BEN
            “Get laid in the shade!”
Then smacks his head. “Laid in the shade”? Really? Burning 
with shame he hops on his bike.
Through the parking lot past a DERRY POLICE BOOTH, where a 
little gathering of cops eat donuts (CHIEF BORTON among them) 
not doing jack shit. The school MARQUEE reads:
                        REMEMBER THE CURFEW 
                                7 P.M.
                      DERRY POLICE DEPARTMENT
Find Bill, Eddie, Richie and Stanley nearby watching -- 
The mother of Dorsey Corcoran, sleepless and desperate, scans 
the throngs of departing kids. Her desperate eyes fall on 
Bill, Richie, Eddie and Stanley. They avert their stares. 
                        STANLEY 
            She actually expecting to see him?
                        EDDIE
            Like, Dorsey Corcoran’s been hiding 
            in Home Ec the last three weeks.
                        BILL
            You think they’ll find him? 
                        RICHIE
            Sure they will. In a ditch. All 
            decomposed, covered in worms and 
            maggots and smelling like Eddie’s 
            Mom’s va--
Richie is CHECKED TO THE PAVEMENT by Travis Bowers. His 
glasses fall off and a pile of comics and video game 
magazines spill from his back pack. 
                        TRAVIS
            Sorry chode. Didn’t see you. 
Travis kicks the glasses away. Victor grabs Stanley’s 
yarmulke and tosses it into the window of a departing bus.  
                                                                 14.

                        VICTOR
            Frisbee, fuck nut. 
Belch burps in Eddie’s face. Eddie wilts. Bill scoops up the 
remains of Richie’s glasses, smashed by the bus. 
                        BILL
            You suck, B-B-B-B-Bowers!
Travis and his goons turn. They stare at Bill menacingly. 
                        TRAVIS
            You s-s-say something, p-p-pussy? 
Everyone around them stops and watches, waiting for Bill to 
respond. Eddie gives Bill a look to shut it. He does. 
                        TRAVIS (CONT’D)
            Yeah, thought so. You got a free 
            ride this year because of your 
            little brother. But ride’s over, 
            Denbrough... 
He starts to move toward Bill. But he catches sight of Chief 
Borton. Or more importantly, OFFICER BOWERS. Travis’ father. 
Sadly, we’ll meet him more officially later.
Travis looks back at Bill and the others. Tension. He steps 
back, giving the Boys some room to breathe. But not too much.
                        TRAVIS (CONT’D)
            This summer’s gonna be a hurt 
            train, for you and your faggot 
            friends... 
He heads off toward Victor’s Trans Am. 

EXT. WITCHAM STREET - STRIP MALL - DAY 
Backpacks. Unzipped. Stuffed with old homework, school 
projects, battered notebooks, broken pencils. 
Bill, Richie, Stanley and Eddie shake their backpacks out 
over a dumpster in the back of Keene’s Pharmacy. 
Purging themselves of the school year. 
                        EDDIE
            Best feeling ever.
                        RICHIE
            I know one that’s better.
                                                                 15.

Masturbating. 
                        BILL
            B-Barrens tomorrow, right? 
Eddie, Richie and Stanley look at each other. The mood has 
changed. Back to Bill: 
                        STANLEY
            Are we really going to start off 
            the summer looking for dead Dorsey? 
                        EDDIE
            Stan --
                        BILL
            He isn’t dead. 
                        STANLEY
            Just missing. Right. Sorry, Bill.
Richie sees Mike on his bike pedaling past ‘em. Richie waves. 
                        RICHIE
            Hey homeschool... 
                        MIKE
            Hey... 
They watch as Mike continues on, ultimately disappearing 
around the corner. Like he’s some sort of urban legend. 
                        RICHIE
            Do home-schooled kids even get 
            summer vacation, ya think? 
                        EDDIE
            Their whole life is summer 
            vacation... 
                        STANLEY
            I don’t know. I bet it’s lonely. 
Nevermind that -- 
                        BILL
            S-So tomorrow? Barrens? 
                        STANLEY
            We’ll be there. 
They all peel off in different directions. Bill and Richie on 
their bikes, Eddie and Stanley on foot.  
                                                                 16.

INT. BILL DENBROUGH’S HOUSE - DAY 
Dust collects on the piano in the living room.  A stale quiet 
suffocates the house. The only sound the ticking of a clock 
and the distant yelling of playing children.

EXT. BILL DENBROUGH’S HOUSE - DAY 
Bill walks up his driveway as -- 
                        BILL
            He th-th-thrusts his fists against 
            the po-po-po-po-SH-SH-SHIT... 
Breathe deep, Bill. Take it slow. 
                        BILL (CONT’D)
            He th-thrusts his fists against the 
            po-posts... B-but still insists he 
            s-sees the ghosts. 
Skids to a stop at the mailbox. He opens it and sifts through 
mail, coming across a BROCHURE FOR ACADIA NATIONAL PARK.
His face lights up.  
                        BILL (CONT’D)
            Hey Ma. 
She’s watering their planters, mind a million miles away. 
Only when one overflows and spills onto her shoes does she 
snap out of it -- 
                        SHARON
            Damn it, Bill. You could’ve said 
            something. 
She goes to the spigot and turns off the hose. 
                        ZACH (O.S.)
            Bill! That you?!
Bill pushes his bike up to the GARAGE, brochure in hand. 
Sees his dad, ZACH DENBROUGH (40), sits at his woodworking 
bench whittling a lump of wood into a DUCK DECOY. Behind him 
dozens of colorfully painted decoys are arranged on display. 
                        BILL
            Western Grebe. Want help painting -- 
                        ZACH
            I thought we agreed. 
                                                                 17.

He points to the corner, which is taken up by an elaborate, 
labyrinthine, scale model of the Derry sewers made out of 
yellow plastic hamster tubes. 
                        BILL
            Before you say anything. 
                        ZACH
            Bill -- 
                        BILL
            Just let me show you something 
            first... 
Bill grabs a G.I. JOE ACTION FIGURE off the tool bench and 
sticks it in the tubes. He turns on the hose, sprays it at 
the model, and G.I. Joe goes sweeping through the plastic 
tunnels. Shooting onto the drain marked “Barrens.” 
                        BILL (CONT’D)
            The Barrens. It’s the only place -- 
                        ZACH
            He’s gone, Bill. 
                        BILL
            But if the storm swept Georgie in, 
            we should’ve -- 
                        ZACH
            He’s gone. He’s dead. What’s done 
            is done. Now please take it down. 
Zach folds a SEWER MAP that Bill had stapled above. 
                        ZACH (CONT’D)
            And next time you take a sewer map 
            from my workshop ask permission. 
Gut punched. Bill looks to a HAMSTER IN AN EMPTY CAGE. 
                        BILL
            Guess you get your tunnels back. 
As he starts disassembling the model -- quietly, to himself -- 
                        BILL (CONT’D)
            He thrusts his fi-fists... against 
            the po-posts... 
Water leaks from the mouth of the hose and pools slowly at 
his feet. A sinister tremor disturbs its surface, or the 
reflection of a face...
                                                                 18.

EXT. COSTELLO AVENUE MARKET - LATER 
Mike exits and hops on his bike. Doesn’t notice Victor’s 
Trans Am pass him on the street. But we do. And as Mike takes 
off in the other direction we keep with the Trans Am as it 
stops and makes a slow U-Turn. Uh-oh...

EXT. EDGE OF TOWN - DIRT ROAD - LATER 
Mike on his bike. On his own. Working his way back to the 
Hanlon Homestead when -- 
Victor’s Trans Am appears behind him. 

INT. VICTOR’S TRANS AM - CONTINUOUS
Victor behind the wheel. Travis reaches over and HONKS the 
horn. Mike turns. “Oh shit...” all over his face.

EXT. EDGE OF TOWN - DIRT ROAD - CONTINUOUS 
Mike pedals fast as the Trans Am screams up on him, like it’s 
going to chew ‘im up and spit him out. At the last second -- 
Mike turns off the road. Losing control of his bike. Leaps 
off but its speed keeps it upright and it CRASHES into -- 
A GNARLED, LIFELESS TREE. 
Trans Am blasts past Mike. Amazing you can even hear their 
laughter over the roaring engine. Leaning out of the window -- 
                        TRAVIS
            Stay the fuck out of my town!
Trans Am disappears around the bend. But it isn’t until the 
sound of the engine fades that Mike gets back to his feet. 
Collects himself.
Walks back to his bike, half-hidden in the bushes. Rips it 
free from the brushwood and kneels to examine it.
Bent rim, broken spokes, snapped chain. 
As he inspects the tires, he freezes. Like he senses a 
presence behind him. He turns right as -- 
Something darts into the bushes. Can’t be sure what it was 
but it looked like a messy mass of MELTED HANDS.
                                                                 19.

Not wanting to investigate further, Mike stands and starts to 
quickly push his bike back onto the road and out of town.

INT. DERRY SYNAGOGUE - DAY
Stanley reads from the TORAH as the RABBI -- aka Stanley’s 
Dad -- watches over his shoulder. Waiting for a fuck up. 
                        STANLEY
            Baruk atah Adonai, eloheynu 
            meleek...
There it is. 
                        RABBI
            Melehk. Start again. 
Trying harder -- nervous -- 
                        STANLEY
            Baruk atah Adonai, eloheynu 
            melehk... melehk...
Oy vey -- 
                        RABBI
            Ha‘olam...  
                        STANLEY
            Ha’olam, asher bahkar mikal..
                        RABBI
            Banu mikal! You’re not studying, 
            Stanley. You’re not studying and 
            yet this is exactly what this time 
            is about... Taking responsibility 
            for one’s own religious life. If 
            you don’t want to study for you, 
            think of your mother. Think of me. 
            How is it going to look if the 
            Rabbi’s son can’t even finish his 
            reading? Do you want to bring shame 
            on me and your mother, after all 
            we’ve done for you?
                        STANLEY
            No, sir.
                        RABBI
            Or on people of this Synagogue?
                        STANLEY
            No, sir.
                                                                 20.

                        RABBI
            On yourself?
Stanley shakes his head.
                        STANLEY
            No, sir. 
                        RABBI
            Your actions say otherwise. 
Stanley’s eyes well up with tears. Doesn’t want to be a 
disappointment. Not to his Father. Not to anyone. 
The Rabbi hands Stanley the scroll.
                        RABBI (CONT’D)
            Put the scroll away. No one up here 
            is using it anyway. 

INT. DERRY SYNAGOGUE, DOWNSTAIRS - MOMENTS LATER
Ashamed, Stanley walks down the old, molding stone stairs to 
the basement of the synagogue. He finds his 
DAD’S OFFICE
A scholar’s study. Rabbinical papers, journals, and books. So 
many books. On one of the walls hangs a PAINTING: Judith. 
Standing naked, holding her sword in one hand and the 
decapitated, bloody head of Holofernes in the other. 
Stanley glances up at Judith as he passes with the scroll. 
Like he can’t help himself. Even though he’d rather not. 
Creak... 
Behind him, the Door to the Mikveh OPENS. A darkness beyond, 
seems to beckon him. Stanley steps toward. Like he might 
enter. But instead -- 
He SLAMS the door shut. Spooked. 

EXT. NEIBOLT STREET - DAY 
Eddie walks down the street with crumbling asphalt that runs 
along the canal and the OLD TRAIN YARD. 
Beep beep beep. He looks at his Casio Calculator Watch. Alarm 
has been set. Stops. Digs into his pocket. 
                                                                 21.

Pulls out a BOTTLE OF PILLS. Open it and dumps a few into his 
hand. Different colors. About to pinch one up but -- 
Man, can’t shake the feeling he’s being watched.
He looks over at 
THE HOUSE ON 29 NEIBOLT STREET
A plot infested with giant ratty sunflowers that hem in an 
abandoned, boarded up structure with a rotted, sloping facade 
that looks like Munch’s The Scream. 
But no sign of anyone inside. Or out. 
Unnerved, Eddie quickly looks at his pills. Starts to walk 
again as he tries to put them back in the bottle when -- 
CoughCough. 
Not sure from where. 
Startles Eddie. Drops his pills. They scatter over asphalt. 
                        EDDIE
            Shit.
He looks back over at The House on 29 Neibolt Street. 
Still no sign of anyone. 
But hey, do you remember if the Front Door was open before? 
Because it is now. 
Eddie quickly kneels. Trying to collect his scattered pills 
and stuff ‘em back into his Medicine Bottle. 
                        EDDIE (CONT’D)
            Moms gonna kill me... 
He reaches for A RED PILL when -- 
SOMEONE ELSE’S HAND picks it up instead. And let me tell you 
about this hand. If I can. Without throwing up. 
Start with The Thumb. Or what’s left of it. Because really 
it’s nothing more than a NUBBIN which serves as an outpost in 
a sea of flaky flesh full of Open Sores and Hanging Scabs. 
Glistening with puss. And snot. Probably a mix of both.
It is the Hand of Disease. 
                                                                 22.

It is the preview -- the amooze blech -- of what is to come 
as Eddie looks up and sees -- 
A leprous, tumorous HOBO. A case study for Everything Awful 
Ever. A wet sponge of sickness. 
                        HOBO
            Think these’ll help me? 
Hobo COUGHS again. 
Eddie squishes his face. He can feel the spittle stick and 
his skin absorb the messy microbes especially as -- 
Hobo blows his nose into his hand. Wipes it on his Coat 
Sleeve. We see the hint of a WHITE RUFFLE underneath. 
I mean, maybe you see it. Or maybe you’re too focused on the 
long string of snot that droops down from his nose. 
                        HOBO (CONT’D)
            Think these’ll make us float? 
Hobo limps toward Eddie. Dragging his dead leg behind him. 
Eddie scrambles back. 
Not realizing he’s making his way closer to The House on 29 
Neibolt Street. Until he turns around and sees -- 
An Orange Glow emanating from underneath the Front Porch. As 
if a sunset is happening just beyond the rotted lattice. 
Eddie. 
Fixated on that glow. 
As the Hobo gets closer and closer. 
We might lose Eddie here but -- 
BeepBeep. 
Of his Watch again. 
Blinks. 
Eddie realizes the Hobo is right on him -- how’d he get to 
him so quick? -- and takes off running into the 
BACK YARD
Reaches the Chain Link Fence. 
                                                                 23.

Looks back at the House and sees -- 
Pennywise. 
On the Back Porch. 
Holding a bunch of Stringed Balloons in one hand as he waves 
to Eddie with the other.
                        PENNYWISE
            Where ya going, Eds? If you lived 
            here you’d be home by now!
Scared sick, Eddie begins to climb the fence. Not an easy 
feat for someone of his weak and feeble nature.  
Falls to the other side. 
Looks back. Ready to see something even worse but -- 
Pennywise is gone. 
Eddie pulls out his Inhaler. Takes a puff. 

INT. HANLON HOUSE - NIGHT 
Mike picks at his food. Leroy studies him. Half-amused. 
                        LEROY
            Long day? 
Mike. Lost in thought. 
                        LEROY (CONT’D)
            Something happen while you were out 
            on collections? 
Says that like he already knows the answer. Which is why Mike 
glances up at him. For a small moment. 
                        LEROY (CONT’D)
            Saw your bike. You have another run 
            in with the Bowers boy? Or is it 
            something else...  
                        MIKE
            Something else like what? 
                        LEROY
            Dunno. You tell me.
And right before we think Mike is going to confide in his 
grandfather, he stops. Has questions of his own:  
                                                                 24.

                        MIKE
            Why do we live outside of town? Is 
            it because of the Bowers? 
                        LEROY
            No. We live out here because I want 
            the best for my grandson. See, it’s 
            not just the Bowers that ain’t 
            right... It’s that whole town 
            that’s wrong...
Before going further, he pauses to consider his grandson. Is 
he old enough? He decides. Sets down his fork. He leans in. 
It’s time for him to learn the truth about Derry: 
                        LEROY (CONT’D)
            Do you know what a haunt is?

INT. EDDIE’S KITCHEN - DAY
While Eddie watches, Bill and Richie raid the kitchen like 
feral animals, stuffing Capri Suns, a bag of marshmallows, 
whatever snacks they can find into their backpacks.
                        EDDIE
            What if someone catches us--
                        BILL
            It’s the public works. We’re the 
            public, aren’t we? 
One cabinet is FULL OF PILLS. Ignoring that, the boys collect 
their things and head into the 
LIVING ROOM
On their way out the Front Door. MRS. KASPBRAK, an enormous 
300-pound woman, is stuffed into a recliner. Muumuu. Moles. 
Curlers. Painting her nails as her eyes are glued to Donahue 
on their small Zenith TV. Maybe she won’t notice them leav--
                        MRS. KASPBRAK
            Eddie-bear -- 
Damnit. She did. 
                        MRS. KASPBRAK (CONT’D)
            -- where you boys off to in such a 
            rush...? 
Eddie to Bill and Richie: Help. Please. 
                                                                 25.

                        BILL
            Uh, just my b-backyard, Mrs. K. We 
            got a new badminton set.
She looks them over, assessing whether this is a lie.
                        MRS. KASPBRAK
            Okay, but sweetie don’t go rolling 
            around on the grass. Especially if 
            it’s just been cut. You know how 
            your allergies can get.
                        EDDIE
            Yes, ma.
                        BILL
            I’ll take good care of him, Mrs. K.
Almost home free but -- 
                        MRS. KASPBRAK
            Eddie? Aren’t you forgetting 
            something? 
Eddie slumps. Knows exactly what he’s forgetting. He trudges 
over to his Mother. As the other boys watch. Kisses his 
Mother on the cheek. She smiles. 
                        RICHIE
            Want one from me too, Mrs. K? 
Bill chokes down laughter. Mrs. Kaspbrak shoots a look at 
Richie. Like, you wish. On their way out --
                        EDDIE
            Knock it off, Rich. 

INT. DERRY LIBRARY - READING ROOM - LATER 
Green globes, curved iron staircases, shadowy charm. Ben sits 
at one of the long tables. Outside the Window, he sees -- 
Bill, Richie, Eddie and Stanley pedal past. A sharp reminder 
of his solitary state. He looks down at a POSTCARD. Reads the 
poem he’s written on it:  
                        BEN
            Your hair is winter fire/ January 
            Embers/ My heart burns there, too
Satisfied, he addresses the postcard to “Bev Marsh” when -- 
THUMP!
                                                                 26.

Pointy-nosed MRS STARRET, 40s, slaps a dusty old book on the 
table next to Ben. He jumps, startled. Jeezus... 
                        MRS. STARRET
            Found it. It was behind the 
            radiator in the basement.
                        BEN
            Thank you, Mrs. Starret. Why wasn’t 
            it in the stacks? 
He goes for it but Mrs. Starret slides it back. Out of reach.
                        MRS. STARRET
            Isn’t it summer vacation? I would 
            think you’d be ready to take a 
            break from the books.
                        BEN
            I like it in here. 
He glances at a newspaper on a table there, a headline with a 
grisly photo reads: “BODY FOUND BY CANAL NOT CORCORAN BOY”
                        BEN (CONT’D)
            My mom works two jobs so it’s 
            better than being home alone. 
                        MRS. STARRET
            A boy should be spending his summer 
            outside with friends. Don’t you 
            have any friends?
                        BEN
            Can I have the book now? 
MOMENTS LATER 
Ben slides the dusty old book to him, its jacket reads:  “A 
HISTORY OF OLD DERRY BY BRANSON BUDDINGER.” 
He flips through pages. Through history. Renderings of Early 
Penobscot settlements. Looting by the British in 1812. 
Sawmill boom soon after. And then PHOTOGRAPHS. Like this one: 
Children at the OLD IRONWORKS, in their Easter best holding 
baskets of eggs, gathered around a CIRCUS WAGON.  Whatever 
they are looking at, entertained by, is just out of sight.
He turns the page and is greeted with a HEADLINE: 
         EASTER EXPLOSION KILLS 88 CHILDREN, 102 TOTAL
                                                                 27.

Underneath, another PHOTOGRAPH of the Ironworks. Or what’s 
left of it. Which isn’t much. He turns the page to find -- 
A PHOTOGRAPH. 
Townspeople surround a tree. Pointing up at something in its 
branches, with varied versions of horrified expressions. 
What is it? There in the branches? 
Ben turns the page. Same Picture. Almost. Because we’re 
CLOSER now to the object in the tree. Ben turns the page 
again. CLOSER. Another page. CLOSER. Another. CLOSER. 
This continues until we’re right in the branches with -- 
THE DECAPITATED HEAD OF A SMALL CHILD. 
Ben slams the book shut and pushes it away.  He looks around 
the library, spooked. Mrs. Starret blithely stamps books 
behind her desk. Everyone goes about their business.
But what about -- 
THAT PINK EASTER EGG
At the top of the stairs leading to the Archives. 
Does no one else see it? 
Curious, Ben gets up from the table. Grabs his postcard and 
stuffs it into his pocket. Eyes on the egg. Walks over. 
He picks the egg up. Hefts it. 
Ben looks around, getting the uneasy sense he’s being 
watched. He’s about to turn back when he sees -- 
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS
ANOTHER EASTER EGG. Yellow. With a RED BALLOON tied around 
it. Ben goes down into the 
ARCHIVES ROOM
Even in the daytime it’s dark. So there’s no telling what 
stalks the labyrinthine aisles with high-walled shelves. 
Ben picks up the yellow egg. Stares at it. Considering. 
                        VOICE (O.S.)
            That one is mine!
                                                                 28.

A SMALL HAND snatches the Easter Egg from Ben. Startles the 
hell out of him. He sees a BOY, 8, disappear down an aisle.
He’s carrying an Easter Egg Basket and wears a Knicker Suit, 
as was the style at the beginning of last century. 
                        BEN
            Wait!
Ben chases after him. 
Loses him in the aisles. But a growing sense of fear as he 
rounds the corners. What was that? And that? 
Noises. Fade. Shadows. Creep. 
Ben finds himself back at the beginning. 
Crack.
Like a dropped egg. 
Ben looks over at the stairs. Yolk oozes down a step. 
                        BOY
            Look what I found, Benny.
From the top, the Boy takes a step down. Only his legs are 
visible, the rest of him obscured by the overhang. 
He takes another step. Wobbly, like he might fall. A little 
more of him is revealed. No basket. So he uses the crook of 
his arm for his eggs. Not the best way to transport ‘em and -- 
Crack. 
One more egg gone. 
He takes another step down. Revealing his torso. And then 
another step, revealing -- 
The Boy. Headless. Little wisps of smoke curl up into the 
air, coming out of the gaping hole that used to be his neck. 
He takes another step and loses the other eggs. 
Crackcrackcrackcrack... 
Ben takes off running into the aisles. Boy chases. Ben 
screams, running as fast as his fat legs can take him. Until 
he runs right into -- 
Mrs. Starrett. 
                                                                 29.

                        MRS. STARRETT
            I think it’s time you leave. 
Ben. Catching his breath. Looks behind him. No sign of the 
Headless Boy. Or the eggs. 

EXT. DERRY LIBRARY - DAY 
Ben exits. Rattled. Clutching the postcard. Crosses over to 
MONUMENT SQUARE
Walks by the STATUE OF THE GOVERNOR OF MAINE. Its eyes seem 
to follow Ben. Sensing this, Ben meets its gaze. Unnerved.
                        TRAVIS (O.S.)
            Where you off to, Chubs? 
Fuck. Travis steps out from behind the statue. Ben stuffs the 
postcard into his bag, spins around and -- 
Behind him, Hockstettler. Victor and Belch on either side. 
                        HOCKSTETTLER
            Can we come? 

EXT. KISSING BRIDGE - MOMENTS LATER 
Travis and the boys drag Ben onto the bridge.  They fling Ben 
against the railing and flip up his sweatshirt, exposing his 
fat belly. Belch slaps it hard. Ben screams.
                        BELCH
            Look at the cellulite!
Victor squishes it in his hands, SQUEALING like a pig. 
Patrick pulls out his lighter and a can of hairspray.
                        HOCKSTETTLER
            Let me light his hair like Michael 
            Jackson.
Hockstettler jettisons a fireball with his make-shift flame 
thrower, just past Ben’s head.
                        TRAVIS
            Just hold him.
Travis pulls the buck knife from his jeans.  Ben’s eyes go 
wide. He looks around for help.  
A CAR putters down the street and crosses the bridge. 
                                                                 30.

An OLD COUPLE sit in front with glazed looks. They catch eyes 
with Ben. See his tears. But do nothing. As the car passes, 
reveal in the backseat -- 
A RED BALLOON. 
                        TRAVIS (CONT’D)
            Okay, new kid.  This is what us 
            locals call the kissing bridge.  
            It’s famous for two things.  
            Sucking face and guess what else? 
Ben scans his surrounding, the bridge’s old wooden beams 
CARVED UP with hundreds of hearts and names of lovers.  
                        BEN
            Wait!  Travis, don’t--
In two quick motions Travis SLASHES A BRIGHT RED “T” in Ben’s 
belly. Victor and Hockstettler laugh. Belch is unsettled.
                        BELCH
            Whoa, Travis.
                        TRAVIS
            Shut up. I’m gonna carve my whole 
            name on this cottage cheese. 
Ben is too shocked to scream. He looks over his shoulder at 
the stream behind him, then back at Travis’s bloody grin.
                        TRAVIS (CONT’D)
            Now say it with me. What comes 
            after T?
Ben plants his heel in Travis’s chest and launches himself 
backward over the railing, out of the grip of Victor and 
Snatch.  Travis is knocked back on his ass onto the pavement.

EXT. KENDUSKAEG STREAM - CONTINUOUS
Ben tumbles down the culvert, fetching up hard against a 
fallen tree. He picks himself up as --
                        TRAVIS
            I’m gonna cut your tits off! I 
            swear to fucking God.
Travis leaps over the railing with the knife, Victor, Snatch 
and Hockstettler right behind.  
Ben darts off across the water into a thicket of woods.
                                                                 31.

THE BARRENS
Travis trips, tangling up his whole crew.  They all go 
splashing down in the stream, where Travis LOSES THE KNIFE.
Travis gropes around for his lost knife, suddenly hysterical.
                        TRAVIS (CONT’D)
            Find my knife!  My old man will 
            kill me! You two find fattie. 
Travis and Victor search the stream, hands passing right by 
where the BLADE IS WEDGED UNDER A LOG. 
Hockstetter and Belch take off after Ben. 
                                                           CUT TO:
A VENTED IRON MANHOLE COVER. Stamped onto it is -- 
                       Derry Sewer Department
This is the Morlock Hole. A cement cylinder that sticks about 
four feet out of the ground. A DRONE. Somewhere deep within.
We move beyond it to reveal, 
THE BARRENS. 
A messy, untamed tract of land. Big and green and wild. We 
follow a trickle of water to its source -- 
A LARGE SEWER DRAINPIPE. 
Eddie paces at the entrance. Stanley moves to join Richie 
further inside, scraping a branch against its grimy 
corrugated walls. Stanley turns to Eds -- 
                        STANLEY 
            Aren’t you coming in? 
                        EDDIE
            Uh-uh. It’s gray water. 
                        RICHIE
            What the hell’s gray water?
                        EDDIE
            Tell ‘em Bill, what your Dad said.
Bill is deeper in the LONG CAVERNOUS SEWER PIPE, which 
extends into pitch darkness. Beyond it though, you get a 
sense of something lurking... something waiting... 
                                                                 32.

                        BILL
            It’s where all the wa-wa-wash water 
            and storm drain runoff goes. 
                        EDDIE
            It’s sewer water. Piss and shit.  
            I’m telling you guys you’re 
            splashing around in millions of 
            gallons of Derry pee.
Richie dips his branch in the water and sniffs the tip.
                        RICHIE
            Smells okay to me.
Bill sees something in the muck and fishes it out.
                        BILL
            Guys. 
                        EDDIE
            Serious. Have you ever heard of a 
            staff infection -- 
                        BILL
            Guys!
They all shut up and turn to Bill, holding a sneaker.
                        STANLEY
            Shit, don’t tell me that’s--
                        BILL
            No. Georgie wore galoshes.
He flips Richie the sneaker, nods to look inside.  Richie 
flashes his key-ring light, sees “D. CORCORAN” written on the 
sole in black marker. 
                        EDDIE
            Who’s sneaker is it?
Bill fishes it out with a branch, afraid to touch it. 
                        RICHIE
            Dorsey Corcoran.
                        EDDIE
            Shit. For real? Oh fuck. That 
            totally freaks me out... 
                                                                 33.

                        RICHIE
            How do you think Dorsey feels? 
            Running around these woods with 
            only one friggin’ shoe.
The Others look at Richie: Did he really just say that?
                        STANLEY
            What if... what if he’s still here? 
They all lock eyes.  
Richie picks up a stick and starts sloshing deeper into the 
dark pipe where the shoe was found. Eddie stays frozen.
                        RICHIE
            Dorsey!?
                        EDDIE
            Really! Stop! We’re gonna get in 
            trouble. Richie!
                        RICHIE
            What?
                        EDDIE
            My mom will have an aneurism if she 
            finds out I was playing down here, 
            I’m serious.
                        RICHIE
            Eds, you get within twenty feet of 
            a peanut she has a cow. Come home 
            with Dorsey Corcoran’s corpse, she 
            might actually have a whole herd.
                        EDDIE
            That’s so not funny. Bill?
Bill, who has been uncommonly quiet, finally speaks.
                        BILL
            If I was D-Dorsey I would want us 
            to find me. Georgie too.
He dumps out a bag of marshmallows and bags the shoe.
                        RICHIE
            Who do you think is doing this? 
                        BILL
            I don’t know. Maybe this will help 
            us find out... 
                                                                 34.

                        EDDIE
            What if I don’t want to find out? 
                        RICHIE
            What? 
                        EDDIE
            No offense, Bill, but I don’t want 
            to end up like... I don’t want to 
            go missing either...
                        STANLEY
            He has a point. 
                        BILL
            Y-y-you too? 
                        STANLEY
            Don’t you guys feel it? It’s like 
            something is out there... watching 
            us... like it wants us... 
                        BILL
            What are you talking about? 
                        RICHIE
            Yeah, Stan. You’re really creep -- 
RUSTLING.
From the bushes. 
They freeze. Waiting. Wondering. Is Stanley right? 
MORE RUSTLING. 
A FIGURE crashes out of the brush. 
Eddie falls back. 
None of ‘em speak as we reveal, Ben. Barely standing before 
them. Beaten. And bloody. 
                        RICHIE (CONT’D)
            Holy fuck.  What happened to you?
Ben collapses.  

EXT. BARRENS - CONTINUOUS
Hockstetter and Belch split up. One going this way. The other 
going that. Hockstetter hears commotion up ahead. The Boys. 
                                                                 35.

He smiles and picks up his pace. Passing the droning Morlock 
Hole as he creeps up toward the Sewer Drainpipe.
Our boys are in for it. 
Hockstetter peeks through the bushes. But no sign of Ben, 
Bill, Richie, Eddie or Stanley. But he hears the ECHO of --  
FOOTSTEPS. 
From inside the Sewer Drainpipe. SplishSplashing through the 
water. Hockstetter enters the -- 
SEWER DRAINPIPE
                        HOCKSTETTER
            I hear ya, fattie.
He giggles, excited by the chase. It bounces off and around 
the sewer walls. As he steps further in. 
Approaching the darkness, Hockstetter pulls out his LIGHTER 
and his can of HAIRSPRAY. Flicks the lighter. Presses down on 
the spray can valve and -- 
Whooosh!
A flickering and licking long stream of flame shoots out 
ahead of him. A makeshift flamethrower. 
Illuminates the Sewer for an instant before -- 
Blackness returns. 
Hockstetter takes a couple more steps. Sound of trickling 
water, faint noise of distant traffic overhead. And... 
...that’s not calliope music is it? For a split second I 
thought I heard... Nah, never mind. Anyway -- 
Whoooosh!
More grey water. More slimy sewer walls. More darkness. 
Hockstetter stops in a SHAFT OF SHARPLY SLICED SUNLIGHT, 
shining through the SEWER GRATE directly above him. 
He listens. 
Something there. In the darkness beyond. PitterPatter of 
Footsteps. Wet, raspy breathing. Sniffling. 
He steps out of the light and into the dark. 
                                                                 36.

                        HOCKSTETTER (CONT’D)
            Don’t think you can stay down here 
            all damn day now!
Whoooosh!
Nothing. Darkness returns and an eerie silence settles in. 
Whooooosh! Whoa -- 
DEAD CHILDREN. 
Surround Hockstetter. Staring at him. Their eyes lit by the 
orange flame. Or is that orange glow coming from within them? 
Can’t tell. Happens all too quick before their cloaked again 
in the black nothingness of the sewer. 
Hockstetter quickly flickers the lighter. 
A soft glow. 
Holds up the spray can. Presses down. But it doesn’t work. So 
he RATTLErattleRATTLES it. Like a rattlesnake about to 
strike. Sound amplified by the tunnels. 
Whooosh!
MORE DEAD CHILDREN. And standing among them... 
Pennywise. 
His smile begins to grow, as his jaw becomes unhinged. 
Revealing rows and rows of teeth right before -- 
Blackness returns. 
Hockstetter about to flick his lighter again but instead -- 
Crunch. 
He SCREAMS. 
Hear his FOOTSTEPS. 
Running.
We don’t see him again until he stumbles and falls into 
another SHAFT OF LIGHT. He looks chewed and spit out. Like a 
bad piece of gristly meat. 
He looks up into the light. 
                                                                 37.

                        HOCKSTETTER (CONT’D)
            HELP! DOWN HERE! HELP!

EXT. KANSAS STREET - CONTINUOUS
On the Sewer Grate. As cars drive past and pedestrians walk 
by. No one hears the horrible screams. Except for us. 
And only because we know it’s there. 

INT. SEWER - CONTINUOUS
Hockstetter looks behind him. Something fast approaching. He 
gets back to his feet. Runs as fast as he’s able. 
In and out of periodic light. 
Stumbles again. Tripping over a RUSTED, BROKEN PIPE. He picks 
it up. Turns. 
                        HOCKSTETTER
            COME ON! COME ON! LET’S GO!
He waits. Ready to throw down. Sees something slowly approach 
in the darkness. Can’t make it out yet... but then barely... 
A RED BALLOON floats toward him. 
Only stops when it gets right up to his bleeding, bruising 
face. So he can see something written on the other side. 
He rotates the balloon to read -- 
                            I LOVE DERRY!
POP!
Balloon breaks. 
Pennywise right behind it. 
Hockstetter opens his mouth to scream. 
Pennywise lunges. 
Dragging Hockstetter back into the blackness for good. 

EXT. RICHARD’S ALLEY - CONTINUOUS
The kids tear into the alley, dazed and bloody Ben riding 
double with Richie, bikes clattering to the pavement. 
                                                                 38.

                        BILL
            You guys wait here.
Bill, Eddie and Stanley disappear around the block.

INT. KEENE’S PHARMACY - DAY
Tampons. Lots of varieties. Too many. Beverly stares at them 
all. Overwhelmed and unsure.  
                        GRETTA (O.C.)
            Dad, I’m gonna take off early...
Gretta appears from the back. Beverly turns away to hide as 
her sworn enemy exits through the Front Entrance right at the 
same time that Bill, Eddie, and Stanley rush in -- 
                        GRETTA (CONT’D)
            Watch it, losers!
We stay with the boys as they race down one of the aisles. 
Eddie snatches cotton balls and antiseptic and bandages off 
the shelf like an expert. Bill checks prices.  
                        BILL
            Woah, that’s a lot of dough.
Eddie pulls out one crumbled dollar.
                        EDDIE
            All I got.
                        BILL
            You have an account here don’t you?
                        EDDIE
            You crazy? My mom finds out I 
            bought this stuff for myself I’ll 
            spend the whole weekend in the 
            emergency room getting x-rayed.
They glance at the mirror where MR. KEENE (50s) the grumpy, 
eagle-eyed pharmacist watches them like a hawk as he fills 
prescriptions.  Beverly comes up behind them.
                        BEVERLY
            Where’s the fire?
                        STANLEY
            None of your business.
                                                                 39.

                        EDDIE
            There’s a kid outside, looks like 
            someone killed him.
                        BEVERLY
            Shit. Can I help?

INT. KEENE’S PHARMACY - DAY
Beverly puts her tampons down at the counter. Mr. Keene 
smiles at her.
                        BEVERLY
            I like your glasses, Mr. Keene. You 
            look like Clark Kent.
                        MR. KEENE
                (flattered)
            Oh, I don’t know about that.  
                        BEVERLY
            Can I try them?
Surprised by the request, he tentatively takes them off and 
hands them to Beverly. She puts them on and smiles back.
                        BEVERLY (CONT’D)
            What do you think?
                        MR. KEENE 
            Did Lois Lane wear glasses?
She takes them off and hands them back, knocking over a 
display of CIGARETTES. They clatter to the floor.
                        BEVERLY
            Shoot. Sorry.
Mr. Keene leans down to pick them up. Beverly looks to Bill 
and Eddie who grab the bandages and race out the store. 

EXT. KEENE’S PHARMACY - DAY
Bev strides out. Bill waits for her by the curb under a 
COLORFUL MURAL about the FBI’s ambush of the infamous Bradley 
Gang, a celebrated slice of Derry town history.
                        BILL
            Th-Thanks.
He tries to give her his crumpled bill and some change.  She 
flashes a pack of STOLEN CIGARETTES.
                                                                 40.

                        BEVERLY
            Even Steven.  
She looks over and sees Ben, Eddie and Richie in the alley. 
Staring at her. She waves but then realizes -- 
                        BEVERLY (CONT’D)
            Wait -- Ben from sosh? 
ON BEN
He’s trying to decide what’s worse. Being seen like this or 
being caught listening to New Kids on the Block. 
Answer: Doesn’t matter. They both suck. 
                        BEVERLY (CONT’D)
            You okay? That looks like it hurts. 
Trying to man up -- 
                        BEN
            Nah, I’ll be fine. I just fell. 
                        RICHIE
            Right into Travis.  
                        BILL
            Sh-shut it, Richie. 
                        RICHIE
            Why? It’s the truth...
                        BEVERLY
            Are you sure they got.. the right 
            stuff... to fix you up? 
Ben smiles, nods. The inside joke between them eases the pain 
a bit. He’s about to say something but -- 
                        BILL
            W-we’ll take care of him. Thanks 
            again, Beverly...
                        BEVERLY
            Sure. See you around. 
They watch her walk back down the Alley and turn onto Center 
Street. Bill -- like Ben -- is smitten. 
                        STANLEY
            Good going bringing up Travis, 
            Richie... 
                                                                 41.

                        EDDIE
            Yeah, you heard what she did. 
                        BEN
            What’d she do? 
                        BILL
            Nothing. They’re just rumors.
                        RICHIE
            Who cares if they are or not, this 
            blood ain’t gonna clean itself... 
They get to work on Ben.
But we PAN UP to the MURAL and notice, painted in the shadow 
of one of the windows, a white face watching the ambush with 
a bloodless, sinister smile. PENNYWISE. 
                                                           CUT TO:

A FRESH BANDAGE.
Ben peels it away, inspecting the wound underneath.  
                        STANLEY
            How’s it looking? 
                        BEN
            Better... 
They’re at 
BASSEY PARK QUARRY, LOVER’S LEAP 
A massive rock formation. 
Ben looks at Bill, Richie, Stanley and Eddie all stripped to 
their tightie-whities, standing in a line staring at the 
edge, the black water foreboding, endless.  
                        BILL
            Who’s first?
                        RICHIE
            Eddie?
                        EDDIE
            Screw that.
Ben walks over. He wants to earn his keep. 
                                                                 42.

                        BEN
            I’ll go.
                        EDDIE
            With those cuts you have on your 
            chest, I’m not sure if getting in 
            this water--
                        RICHIE
            Will you stop with the grey water 
            shit. You make it seem like any 
            water we get in is like swimming in 
            an out-house.
                        BEN
            What’s grey water?
                        RICHIE
            Don’t get him started.
                        BILL
            I’ll go first.
                        BEVERLY (O.C.)
            Gang of sissies.
The boys turn around to see Bev stripping out of a one piece 
summer dress down to her underwear.  Before they can 
comprehend what’s happening, she sprints off the edge and 
jumps into the water. BOOM. Cannonball.
The Boys look at one another. And then one by one -- 
They jump. 
Don’t know what color your eyes are baby but your hair is 
long and brown... 

EXT. BASSEY PARK QUARRY, SHORE - LATER 
...legs are strong, and you’re so so long and you don’t come 
from this town... 
Beverly lays out on a rock. She’s sun-drenched. As Richie’s 
Boom Box nearby continues playing Love and Rocket’s 1989 
summer radio hit “I’m Alive”. 
Bill, Ben, Stanley, Richie, Eddie lay on other rocks, leaving 
a distance between them and Beverly. None of ‘em bold enough 
to lay near her. But all of ‘em wishing they were as they 
sneak their stares in. 
I’m alive, huh, huh, so alive... 
                                                                 43.

Beverly turns to lay on her stomach, the sudden movement 
startling the boys, so they all look away. Busy themselves 
with other things... 
Like Richie turns to Ben’s Backpack. Filled with books and 
papers. He starts to go through it as he realizes -- 
                        RICHIE
            Newsflash, school’s out for summer. 
                        BEN
            That’s library stuff. Not school 
            stuff...
Richie finds The Postcard.
                        RICHIE
            Who sent you this? 
Ben snatches it away. 
                        BEN
            No one. 
He looks over at Beverly. Specifically, at her KNAPSACK. 
Eddie flips through a book on the History of Derry. 
                        EDDIE
            What’s with the history project?
                        BEN
            Oh, uh, when I moved here I didn’t 
            have anyone to hang out with or 
            anything, so I just started 
            spending time in the library. 
                        RICHIE
            Seriously? You went to the library?   
            On your own? For fun? 
Bill and Richie take a closer look. Beverly joins them. 
                        BEVERLY
            I want to see too... 
She sits down next to Bill. He can barely concentrate with 
her so close to him. Skin smells like sun lotion. 
Beverly looks at him and smiles. Not sure what to do -- oh, 
awkward youth -- Bill turns back at Ben’s Research.  
                                                                 44.

A XEROX shows an 1879 newspaper story with two old photos: 
the first of loggers posed in front of the Silver Dollar 
Saloon with schooners of beer in one hand and axes in the 
other, the second of five bodies chopped up on the sawdust 
floor. Headline screams: “FIVE MASSACRED IN BROAD DAYLIGHT”
                        BEVERLY (CONT’D)
            Why is it all of people getting 
            killed and missing kids?
                        BEN
            Dunno. That’s Derry I guess.
                        EDDIE
            Like any town, right, been around 
            long enough, bad things happen? I 
            mean, all history is a long line of 
            bad things happening to people.

                        BEN
            Yeah, but Derry’s not like any town 
            I moved to. And we’ve moved a lot. 
            Did you guys know people die 
            violently here or disappear like 
            six times the national average? 
                        BEVERLY
            You read that?
                        BEN
                (nodding)
            That’s just adults. Kids are worse.  
            Way worse. 
The Kids look at each other. Creepy...
                        BEN (CONT’D)
            I’ve got more stuff if you wanna 
            see it... 
Off their “Fuck Yes” faces -- 

INT. BEN’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Panicking, Ben hurries into his messy bedroom. We can hear 
the others coming up the stairs behind him as he kicks dirty 
underwear under the bed -- tosses PJs in his dresser -- 
stuffs books of poetry into his desk right before -- 
Beverly enters. 
                                                                 45.

Followed close behind by the other Losers. 
Ben turns, wondering what he was thinking to invite them all 
here. Jeezus, what did he forget? 
All the attention is on his Bedroom Walls. Every inch is 
papered with more Xerox Copies of Newspaper Articles and 
Photographs. All on the History of Derry. Loggers drinking 
beer in the Silver Dollar in the 1880s. Little Kids on an 
Easter egg hunt at the Old Ironworks in 1907. FBI MEN stand 
over a bank robber’s bullet riddled car in the 1930s.
                        RICHIE
            Wow... 
                        BEN
            Cool, huh? 
Richie looks at him, concerned. 
                        RICHIE
            No. 
Stanley sees a copy of an old document with 90 signatures.  
INCORPORATION OF THE TOWNSHIP OF DERRY. 
                        STANLEY
            What’s this? Declaration of 
            Independence?
                        BEN
            The charter for Derry Township.
                        RICHIE
            Nerd alert... 
Ben quickly looks over at Beverly. Trying to cover -- 
                        BEN
            No, it’s kind of interesting. Derry 
            started as a beaver trapping camp.
                        RICHIE
            Still is. Am I right, boys? 
Beverly shakes her head. Bill throws him a look: D-dude...
                        BEN
            Ninety-one people signed the 
            charter that made Derry.  But then, 
            later that winter, they all 
            disappeared, without a trace.
Lets it sink in. He’s got ‘em. 
                                                                 46.

                        EDDIE
            The entire camp?
Eddie is freaked out by this revelation. 
ON BEN’S DESK
Next to some half-built models, Bill finds a few SLIDES. 
Holds them ONE BY ONE up to the light as Ben continues:
                        BEN
            There were rumors of Indians but no 
            sign of an attack. Others thought 
            it was a plague or something. It 
            was like everyone just woke up one 
            day and left. The only clue was a 
            big hole in the ground where the 
            wellhouse was.
                        RICHIE
            Jesus, we could get Derry on 
            unsolved mysteries!
Intrigued by all the stories, Beverly finds herself over by 
Ben’s Bedroom Door. Obscuring more articles. She starts to 
close the door to get a better look and sees a POSTER 
hanging’ tough on the back. New Kids on the Block.
She turns and sees Ben. Beet red, staring right at her. 
Horrified. That’s what he forgot...  
Beverly quickly opens the door again before any of the other 
kids see it. Ben exhales, relieved. Kind of. 
ON BILL. Holding up another slide: The First Map of Derry. 
                        BILL
            Wh-where was the wellhouse?
                        BEN
            Somewhere in town, I guess... 
                        STANLEY 
            What’s the point of all this? What 
            are you gonna do with it?
                        BEN
            Dunno. Just killing time I guess.
                        RICHIE
            Benny boy, if you’re gonna start 
            killin’ time with us fools, do it 
            right... 
                                                                  47.

 Richie opens his backpack, full of teeth rotting and MSG-
 filled goodies. The kids pounce. Bill looks thoughtfully over 
 the walls and books, then at DORSEY CORCORAN’S SHOE. 

 INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
 Bill hands Dorsey Corcoran’s shoe, still wet in a marshmallow 
 bag, a map rolled into it, to Chief Borton (50s, pudgy).  The 
 wall behind him is plastered with fliers of kids, each with 
 “MISSING” or “MURDERED” over their smiling faces -- with 
 names like Dorsey Corcoran, Betty Ripson, Chad Lowe, Missy 
 Albrecht, and others aged 3 to 19.
                         BILL
             We found it in the barrens.
 Borton looks over at Officer Bowers. Christ...
                         CHIEF BORTON
             Thank you, son, we’ll take it from 
             here...
                         BILL
             If it’s a serial killer aren’t you 
             suppose to call in the F-F-FBI or 
             something?
                         OFFICER BOWERS
             The FFFBI? They must be real 
             official... 
 Laughs, proud of his own joke but --  
                         BILL 
             This isn’t some joke. Look at all 
            the bad stuff that happens here.  
            People disappear here six times 
            more than the nat-nat-national 
            average. With kids it’s even wo-
            worse and what do you do? Nothing. 
                        CHIEF BORTON
            These things happen. Every now and 
            then a town suffers some weather, 
            doesn’t mean we need outsiders 
            lifting the lid in our outhouse.
            Derry can take care of her own.
                        BILL
                 (pissed)
            Y-y-you... 
Prick? Asshole? Fucknut?
                                                                 48.

                        BILL (CONT’D)
            Useless. 
He turns and leaves. 

INT. BEVERLY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
A slummy apartment over Lower Main Street. Beverly’s Dad, MR. 
MARSH (late 30s), still in his janitor’s uniform from Derry 
Home Hospital, sits passed out in front of the TV.  
Entering the apartment, Beverly quietly tiptoes past him. 

INT. BEVERLY’S APARTMENT, BEVERLY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Beverly dumps out her knapsack. Among her belongings, she 
finds a POSTCARD. With a familiar poem. 
From the Living Room, her Father clears his throat. Is he up? 
Taking no chances, she hurries into the 
BATHROOM 
With the Post Card. Shuts the door. Locks it. Reads the poem 
aloud to herself -- 
                        BEVERLY
            Your hair is winter fire/ January 
            Embers/ My heart burns there, too
It’s from ‘Your Secret Admirer’. 
Beverly blushes. Sees there isn’t any return address. As she 
wonders who it could be from she hears -- 
                        CHILD’S VOICE (O.S.)
            Help me.
Beverly looks around for the voice, startled.
                        CHILD’S VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
            Help me, Beverly.
It comes from THE SINK DRAIN, above her head. She leans 
forward over the basin, looking down into the dark void...
                        BEVERLY
            Is s-someone there?
Nothing. BEV’S EYE PEERS DOWN THROUGH THE CIRCLE OF LIGHT.
                                                                 49.

                        CHILD’S VOICE (O.S.)
            We all want to play with you.
She gasps. The single voice turns into a cacophony, bubbling 
up through the ages.
                        CHILD’S VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
            Come play with us, Beverly.  Come 
            play with the clown.  You’ll float.
Terrified, Beverly dashes out.

INT. BILL’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Bill’s mom washes the dishes while Bill sits at the table and 
eats a bowl of ice cream. Zach flips through a Popular 
Mechanics, still in his overalls from the DERRY PUBLIC WORKS.
                        BILL
            Did you guys see the brochure?
No response. Finally his dad stirs.
                        ZACH
            Sorry?
                        BILL
            Acadia. I thought we could start 
            planning our park trip this year.
His dad stops mid flip, looks to Bill’s mom who’s on edge.
                        BILL (CONT’D)
            Otter Cove. Bubble Pond. Cadillac 
            Mountain.
His mom throws down a dish and, unable to compose herself, 
storms upstairs. All the air goes out of the room.
                        BILL (CONT’D)
            What did I say?
Zach wants to respond but can’t. He goes to the sink and 
turns off the faucet.
                        ZACH
            Sorry, champ. Your mom and I, we--
                        BILL
            If it’s about money, I’ll mow 
            lawns, paint fences, whatever.
                                                                 50.

                        ZACH
            It’s not that. 
He fiddles his wedding ring. Zach is too upset to look his 
boy in the eye.
                        ZACH (CONT’D)
            Your brother just looked forward to 
            this trip so much, you know. It was 
            his favorite.
He takes Bill’s bowl of ice cream, throws it into the sink 
and goes, Bill’s spoon left hanging over nothing.
                        BILL
            Mine too.

INT. BEVERLY’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Bev finds HER FATHER (40s) now asleep in front of the TV.  
His toolbelt is thrown up on the coffee table.  She creeps 
over and steals the TAPE MEASURE.

INT. BEVERLY’S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - NIGHT
Beverly stands over the sink basin, tape measure in hand. The 
voice is silent.
                        BEVERLY
            Hello?
She unfurls the tape into the drain, its tip disappearing 
into the void. FOOT BY FOOT she snakes the tape into the 
drain, until it’s fully extended at 20 feet. 
She waits for a voice. Nothing.
Slowly, she begins to reel the tape back in, counting down 
the length as it winds back in. 16 feet... 15 feet... 14 
feet... AT 13 FEET VISCOUS BLOOD COATS THE TAPE.
BEVERLY GASPS and drops the measure. It goes clattering into 
the sink, the tape coiling up like a snake, blood flickering 
everywhere as she stumbles back, tripping into the shower.
BLOOD GOUTS UP FROM THE SINK DRAIN 
Like a demonic ejaculation -- blood splatters the mirror, the 
wallpaper, bouncing off walls and covering Beverly. She 
SCREAMS and runs out the door...
                                                                 51.

INT. BEVERLY’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
...into her father, who comes charging up the hall. She 
screams again, recoiling away.
                        MR. MARSH
            You okay, Bevvie?
                        BEVERLY
            The bathroom! In the bathroom--
He places his hand on her cheek, tender.
                        MR. MARSH
            Daddy’s here now. It’ll be okay.
He takes her hand.  They step into...

INT. BEVERLY’S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - NIGHT
Mr. Marsh looks around, eyes wide, blood splattered 
everywhere, but the blood doesn’t register with him. 
                        MR. MARSH
            Bevvie, child, what’s my tape 
            measurer doin’ outta my toolbelt?
He steps over and grabs the BLOOD-COATED TAPE, clipping it 
onto his belt, blood on his hands now too.  
                        MR. MARSH (CONT’D)
            You should ask me if you want to 
            touch my things. I ask you, don’t 
            I?
                        BEVERLY
            I-- I--
He doesn’t seem to see any of it. Only Beverly can.  She 
realizes this.
He pulls back the shower curtain, leaving behind bloody 
fingerprints.  A spider scurries toward the drain.
                        MR. MARSH
            Was that it?  A spider?
Bev’s speechless.  She staggers back.  He catches her wrist.
                        MR. MARSH (CONT’D)
            Bevvie, you okay?
                                                                 52.

                        BEVERLY
            Yes. That’s it. The spider.
                        MR. MARSH
                (smiling)
            I thought so. They can’t hurt you.  
            You know that don’t you?
He crushes the spider under his boot, grinding it in.
                        BEVERLY
            Yes, sir. I’m sorry for waking you.
He comes over to her, smoothing out her hair over her 
forehead, proprietary.  The blood on her face like finger 
paint.  This is when he scares her the most.
                        MR. MARSH
            You worry me, Bevvie. You worry me 
            a lot. 
                        BEVERLY
            I know, daddy.
He rests his forehead against hers, breathes in her scent.
                        MR. MARSH
            You’re growing up so quickly.  
He looks her up and down. 
                        MR. MARSH (CONT’D)
            You were Daddy’s little girl, now, 
            you’re changing. Tell me you’re 
            still Daddy’s little girl? 
She averts her eyes, nods, placating. Satisfied, he goes back 
down the hall to his game. Beverly darts into her bedroom, 
slamming the door behind her. 

INT. DETAIL ON CEILING - NIGHT 
ANGLE ON a wet, dark spot as it grows on a white plaster 
ceiling, the first droplet of water forming. SLOW MOTION as 
it breaks away and falls through space... 
                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

INT. BILL’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
...onto Bill’s face. He doesn’t stir. More droplets follow. 
Tap, Tap, Tap. Finally, Bill awakes. Looks up at: 
                                                                 53.

A leak in the ceiling.
Bill flips back his covers. 

INT. BATHROOM HALLWAY - NIGHT
Bill grabs a bucket from a utility closet and walking back 
sees the door open to the GEORGIE’S ROOM, a light on... 

INT. GEORGIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Bill enters, the room frozen in time. 
GEORGIE’S TOY BOX is open, a Lego Turtle standing next to it, 
as if taken out to play. 
Bill picks it up and sits down, Turtle in hand. He indulges 
in the sadness that has engulfed his home for months. The 
loss of his brother hitting him full force, he closes his 
eyes to fight back the tears, but cannot. 
He cries for Georgie. Photographs of Georgie, illuminated by 
passing cars, seem to watch him from the walls. 
A SHADOW seems to stretch across Georgie’s room from the 
doorway. Bill looks up but no one is there. 

INT. CORRIDOR - BILL’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Bill steps out of Georgie’s room and finds DARK FOOTPRINTS IN 
THE CARPET.  He leans down and touches one -- squishy and 
wet. They track down the dark staircase. 
Bill, heart pounding, follows the wet footprints down the 
stairs, careful not to step in any of them.
                        BILL
            Dad?

INT. DOWNSTAIRS - BILL’S HOUSE - DAY
At the bottom of the stairs Bill finds the footprints lead 
TOWARD THE KITCHEN WHERE...
                        BILL
            Ma?
Bill sees a YELLOW FLASH of something ducking around the 
corner. Startled, Bill drops the Lego turtle, which smashes 
into pieces and scatters across the wood floor... 
                                                                 54.

Bill looks back up the stairs half-expecting his parents to 
wake up. Nothing but an eerie silence. He gathers his courage 
and follows the wet footprints into...

INT. KITCHEN - BILL’S HOUSE - DAY
Bill steps in, face to face with THE CELLAR DOOR, the door 
creaking closed, light snapped on behind it, footprints 
disappearing down into the cellar. 
He slowly approaches the door and reaches out for the handle, 
but stops with second thoughts. He starts backing away, too 
spooked to go down, when he hears...
A CHILD WEEPING BEYOND THE DOOR, then...
                        BILL
                (voice quivering)
            Georgie?

INT. CELLAR - BILL’S HOUSE - DAY
Bill opens the door, rickety stairs leading down into 
darkness, the weeper somewhere in the recesses, along with 
the steady sound of a LEAK. 
Steeling himself, Bill descends. He gets to the last few 
rungs and is thrown off for a moment seeing HIS REFLECTION in 
the basement floor, as if it were A BLACK MIRROR. He realizes 
THE CELLAR HAS FLOODED
Bill looks up toward the leak/weeping sound and sees, curled 
in the same corner where we had that opening POV...
GEORGIE IN HIS YELLOW SLICKER.
Rain rolling off him like he’s still in a storm flooding the 
cellar.  He looks up at Bill, his skin bloodless, paper thin.
                        GEORGIE
            I lost it, Billy. Don’t be mad.
                        BILL
            Georgie?
Bill moves to step into the water when he hesitates, holding 
his foot over it.  He looks to Georgie whose expression of 
distress seems insincere.
                        GEORGIE
            It just floated off.  But, Bill...
                                                                 55.

Bill grabs a rake from the wall and pokes its tip into the 
water. Impossibly, it goes ALL THE WAY TO THE HILT.
                        GEORGIE (CONT’D)
            If you come with me, you’ll float 
            too.
Water and muck pour from his mouth as he says these last 
words, an endless cascade.
Bill recoils, back-peddling up the steps.
Georgie starts to glide over the water toward Bill, who 
realizes there is a creature beyond it, white face half 
submerged like a crocodile, propping up Georgie’s body like a 
MEAT PUPPET. 
PENNYWISE begins to surface.
Horrified, Bill bolts up the steps, slamming and locking the 
basement door behind him.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS - BILL’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Bill runs out of the kitchen, sliding on the scattered Legos 
and cutting his feet. He bounds up the stairs right into...
His dad, wearing PJs. His mom shows at the door, not happy.
                        ZACH
            Easy!  What’s with all the 
            slammming?

INT. BILL’S HOUSE, BASEMENT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER
Bill and Zach stand over the stairwell.  Zach turns the light 
on and walks down, much to Bill’s horror... 
                        BILL
            Dad? Don’t!
Into a puddle of water.
                        ZACH
            Dry as a bone, Bill.  Sure it 
            wasn’t just a dream?
Bill holds himself, too freaked out to speak.
                                                                 56.

INT. TRAVIS BOWERS HOUSE, TRAVIS’ BEDROOM - DAY
Travis puts cream on FRESH BELT LASHES across his back.  All 
around him on the walls are posters of monster trucks. 
A HONK from outside.
He throws down his shirt and goes into the 
LIVING ROOM
Passing his father, Officer Bowers. In his knock off La-Z-Boy 
drinking a beer and watching the newest episode of ‘COPS’. 
                        OFFICER BOWERS
            Where you off to? 
                        TRAVIS
            Out with the guys.
Travis goes to pass him. Officer Bowers reaches out and stops 
his son from going any further. Travis straightens. Knows the  
routine all too well -- 
                        TRAVIS (CONT’D)
            Vic’s house. Probably stop at Red 
            Apple first, pick up some things.  
Officer Bowers stares him down. Like he isn’t sure what to do 
with his son. Most likely knock him around some more. But 
nah, too much work right now. 
                        OFFICER BOWERS
            Get me another beer from the fridge 
            before you leave. 

EXT. TRAVIS BOWERS HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Travis runs out to Victor and Belch waiting in Victor’s Trans 
Am. Belch is in the Passenger Seat. 
                        TRAVIS
            Out.
                        BELCH
            I thought--
                        TRAVIS
            Did I fuckin’ stutter?
Belch gets in the back. 
                                                                 57.

                        BELCH
            You hear from Hockstetter any? Vic 
            and I are wondering -- 
                        TRAVIS
            Who cares. 
                        VICTOR
            What about your dad? He get on you 
            about the knife?
                        TRAVIS
            That fat ass knows he touches me 
            I’ll rip his head off. Now can you 
            fucking drive please and thank you 
            very fucking much?
                        BELCH
            Where to? 
And as if to answer to his question, Mike rides by on his 
bike. Off to collect more payments. 
                        TRAVIS
            Go. 

EXT. LOWER MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS
Bill and Richie wait as Ben, Stanley and Eddie join them. 
                        STANLEY
            What’s going on? 
                        BILL
            Bev called. She’s freaked out about 
            something... Sh-sh-she told us to 
            wait out here until --   
Beverly bursts out of the Apartment Building. 
                        BEVERLY
            You made it. I need to show you 
            guys something... 
                        BEN
            What is it? 
                        RICHIE
            Did we just win the Publishers 
            Clearing house ten million dollar 
            sweepstakes? If Ed McMahon is in 
            there I’m to going to lose my sh-- 
                                                                 58.

                        BEVERLY
            I just need to know I’m not crazy. 
            But my Dad will kill me if he finds 
            out I had boys in our apartment. 
                        BILL
            We’ll leave a lookout. Richie? 
                        RICHIE
            Yeah, whatever. Ed McMahon can 
            wait... 
Bill, Stanley, Ben and Eddie go with Beverly.

INT. BEVERLY’S APARTMENT - DAY
Beverly opens the door. Afternoon sunlight illuminates 
floating dust motes as Bill, Ben, Stanley and Eddie follow 
her to the closed BATHROOM DOOR.
                        BEVERLY
            In there.
                        STANLEY
            What are we about to walk into?
                        BEVERLY
            You’ll see.
She has no intention of going in. Bill pushes past Ben and 
opens the door.
                        EDDIE
            Oh God. Oh God.
THE BLOOD
Still there, faded into maroon clouds on the mirror and 
wallpaper. Eddie reels back into the hallway with Beverly.  
She looks from Ben to Bill.
                        BEVERLY
            You see it?
Bill nods.
                        BILL
            What happened?
Beverly is so relieved she almost cries.
                                                                 59.

                        BEVERLY
            The sink. It came out from there.  
            My Dad couldn’t see it. I thought I 
            was going crazy... 
                        BILL
            You’re not going crazy. I saw 
            something too. 
                        STANLEY
            You did? 
                        BILL
            Georgie. 
                        EDDIE
            Like a ghost?
                        BILL
            N-no. He tried to get me to go into 
            the basement with him. It wasn’t 
            just him either. I saw this 
            other... I don’t know.
                        STANLEY
            What’d you see, Bill? 
                        EDDIE
            The clown, right? 
Bill doesn’t say anything. Which says it all. Eddie starts to 
hyperventilate. Everyone looks over at him. 
                        BEVERLY
            You okay, Eddie? 
                        BILL
            Go outside. Keep Richie company, 
            okay?
Eddie just nods and walks out the door.  
                        BILL (CONT’D)
            We can’t leave it like this.

INT. BEVERLY’S BATHROOM - DAY
Bill, Stanley, Ben and Beverly clean like grim elves, using a 
bucket of hot water, ajax, and some cloth rags. Slowly the 
blood washes out. Reaching for the same rag, Bill and Bev’s 
hands touch, a spark between them.
                                                                 60.

EXT. BEVERLY’S HOUSE - DAY
Eddie and Richie stand lookout on the curb below. Eddie still 
disturbed by what he saw.
                        EDDIE
            So much blood...

INT. BEVERLY’S BATHROOM - DAY
While Ben and Stanley carry out trash bags of soaked towels, 
Bill and Beverly pour the last bucket of pink water down the 
bathtub drain. The bathroom now as clean as it ever was. The 
bucket is filled with blood stained rags.
                        BEVERLY
            January embers...
                        BILL
            Huh? 
                        BEVERLY
            The poem? 
                        BILL
                (embarrassed)
            I don’t really know much poetry. 
He turns on the faucet to flush out the sink. 
                        BEVERLY
            Oh. Nevermind then. I was just... 
They watch the water cyclone around the drain. Hoping the 
awkwardness will get flushed away too... 
                        BEVERLY (CONT’D)
            It’s not true, y’know. What they 
            say about me... 
                        BILL
            I know. I never b-believed it. None 
            of us do. We like ha-hanging with 
            you...   
Beverly smiles. Relieved. Shuts off the water. 
                        BEVERLY
            Thanks, Bill.  
                                                                 61.

                        BILL
            Don’t thank me too much. 
            Unfortunately according to most 
            people hanging with us makes you a 
            loser... 

INT. BEVERLY’S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Ben stands, stunned at the wonder of being in her room. He 
hears a giggle and looks out into the hall. Sees Bill and Bev 
at the end of it, having their moment. 
                                                           CUT TO:
A PUDDLE. 
Reflection of the Losers’ ripple away as they push their 
bikes through it, walking along the stretch of 
KANSAS STREET
That borders the Barrens. 
Beverly looks over at Bill. His brow furrowed. Like he’s 
trying to solve a complicated math problem in his head. 
                        BEVERLY
            What is it, Bill? 
                        BILL
            All that blood at your place, and 
            you s-say your folks didn’t see any 
            of it... Last night at my house, 
            with Georgie and the water, my Dad 
            just acted like everything was 
            normal... I think if you’re a grown 
            up... 
                        EDDIE
            They can’t see It.
                        RICHIE
            Can’t see what? 
                        BEVERLY
            It.
                        BILL
            That’s why the cops won’t help, our 
            parents, teachers... 
They stop. Because up ahead they see VICTOR’S TRANS AM. 
Parked on the side of the road.
                                                                 62.

                        EDDIE
            We should -- 
                        BILL
            Wait. 
He points to MIKE’S BIKE tangled in the weeds next to it. 
                        BILL (CONT’D)
            Isn’t that Mike’s? 
                        BEVERLY
            We have to help him. 
                        RICHIE
            We do? 
                        BILL
            If we don’t, who will? That could 
            be any one of us... 
                                                           CUT TO:
A PILE OF FRESH, GROUND MEAT. Raw, bloody. A fly buzzes 
around it. Like, jackpot...
                        TRAVIS (O.S.)
            Eat it. 
Belch and Victor continue laughing as -- 
Travis’ WORK BOOT pushes Mike’s head closer to the meat in 
the dirt. Mike tries to resist. But Travis pushes harder. 
We’re in the 
BARRENS
                        TRAVIS (CONT’D)
            Eat it, ya fucking mutt. 
Mike’s nose touches the wet meat. The faintest squish. 
Travis pushes down again -- Mike’s hands slip in the gravel -- 
splat! -- his face goes into the meat. 
Travis and his Boys whoop it up. 
Still flat on the ground, Mike wipes the meat off his face. 
And even in the midst of this, something BRIGHT RED in the 
brown and green Barrens catches his eye. 
A CLOWN?!
                                                                 63.

Watching from the fringe. 
Applauding the -- 
WHAM!
Mike gets kicked in the head. Damn, that hurt. Pushed to the 
brink, he forgets what the fuck he just saw. Grabs a fistful 
of meat and -- 
Whips it up at Travis and his Boys. Covers them in blood and 
ribbons of lamb and beef. 
Mike tries to scramble away but -- 
Belch hooks him by the collar. Throws him back down into the 
gravel. Travis jumps on top. Grabs a handful of gravel and -- 
WHAM!
Travis gets hit HARD in the face with a rock. That’ll leave a 
nasty wound that won’t go away for the rest of our story. 
Attention snaps over to the -- 
LOSERS. Standing like saviors. 
                        RICHIE
            Holy shit. 
                        STANLEY
            Nice throw. 
                        BEVERLY
            Thanks. But don’t act so surprised.
                        BILL
                (to Mike)
            RUN!
Mike uses the second of distraction to push off of Travis and 
get back onto his feet. He races over to join the Losers’. 
                        RICHIE
            ROCK WAR!
WHAM! Richie gets pegged with a Rock thrown by Belch. Maybe 
he should have kept his trashmouth shut.
Loser’s pick up more rocks. Starts whipping ‘em at Travis, 
Victor, Patrick, and Snatch. 
The Bowers Gang returns fire. Everybody ducks for cover, 
trying not to get hit. It’s a brutal battle. 
                                                                 64.

Cornered, Bill yells out his orders -- 
                        BILL
            Run! 
They do. And don’t stop until they’re safe. And as they all 
catch their breaths on
CANAL STREET
Mike turns to the group. 
                        MIKE
            Thanks but you shouldn’t have done 
            that. He’ll be after you now too. 
                        EDDIE
            Travis? He’s always after us.
                        BILL
            I-I guess that’s one thing we all 
            have in common... 
                        RICHIE
            Yeah, Homeschool. Welcome to the 
            Losers Club...  
Off our Losers --

TITLE CARD OVER A MANHOLE COVER MARKED “DERRY PUBLIC WORKS”
                          JULY
A foot steps over it as we pan up to... 

EXT. CANAL STREET - DAY
The Town prepares for a celebration. Red, White and Blue 
Banners. Fireworks For Sale Signs. A Brass Band rehearses.
                        BEN
                (pre-lap)
            I was thinking about It. Ironworks 
            explosion in 1904. Bradley Gang in 
            ‘32. The Black Spot in ‘59. And now 
            with Georgie, Dorsey and the 
            rest... It seems like this bad 
            stuff happens nearly every thirty 
            years...   
                                                                 65.

We find the Losers in
MONUMENT SQUARE
On a bench by the Paul Bunyan Statue. 
                        STANLEY
            So what -- this town is cursed? 
                        MIKE
            That’s what my grandfather 
            thinks... 
All eyes on Mike. 
                        MIKE (CONT’D)
            You guys know what a haunt is?
                        RICHIE
            You mean like in a ‘who-ya-gonna-
            call’ sense? 
                        MIKE
            No, not like that... A haunt can 
            also mean like a feeding ground for 
            animals... Or for something else... 
            My grandfather told me he thinks 
            all the bad things that happen in 
            this town are caused by one 
            thing... An evil thing... that 
            feeds off the people of Derry... 
                        STANLEY
            But It can’t be one thing. We’re 
            all seeing something different... 
                        MIKE
            Yeah, but I think it’s because It 
            uses our worst fears to scare us... 
                        BILL
            I guess that’s why I’m seeing 
            Georgie... 
                        EDDIE
            I saw a walking infection. What’d 
            you see, Mike? Anything?
                        MIKE
            Hands. Lots of hands, melted 
            together by fire... 
                        RICHIE
            Oh my God. That. Sounds. Awesome.
                                                                 66.

                        MIKE
            Well, what are you afraid of?
                        RICHIE
            Clowns. 

INT. BILL’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Bill can’t sleep. He lays in bed, eyes wet with tears, as he 
stares at the lone Walkie Talkie on his shelf. Can’t bear to 
look at it any longer, he rolls over to his other side.  
Which is why he doesn’t see -- 
The Walkie’s POWER LIGHT blink GREEN. And a moment holds 
before... 
...STATIC. 
Bill sits up and looks over at the Walkie. Its Talk Light 
BLINKS on. Off. On. He reaches for it when --
                        GEORGIE 
                (through Walkie)
            ...ill? Bill? 
                        BILL
            Georgie?!
He grabs the Walkie. 
                        GEORGIE 
                (through Walkie)
            Help me, Bill. I’m scared. 
                        BILL
                (into Walkie)
            Wh-where are you? 
                        GEORGIE 
                (through Walkie)
            It... It’s dark but it’s like, like 
            a tunnel, an upside down -- 
A BURST of STATIC. LOUD. Before silence. 
Bill. Eyes red. Tears hot. 
                        BILL
                (into Walkie)
            Georgie! GEORGIE!
                                                                 67.

Bedroom Door OPENS. It’s Zach. Backlit by the dim light in 
the Hallway as he says --
                        ZACH
            Bill? What’s going on in here? Why 
            aren’t you asleep?
Clutching the Walkie, Bill looks up at his father. So much to 
say... But would he listen? Would he believe? Bill decides. 
                        BILL
            It’s nothing. Sorry. 
                        ZACH
            Go back to sleep. 
He shuts the door. Shadows return. Darkness and then...
                                                           CUT TO:

BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT. 
Illuminates the Sewer Map taped to the back wall of
DENBROUGH GARAGE
The light is from an OLD CAROUSEL SLIDE PROJECTOR Bill has 
positioned on a couple of stacked boxes. 
The Losers huddle around it like a campfire. 
                        BILL
                (to Ben)
            Did you bring the map? 
Ben pulls a SLIDE out of his pocket and hands it over. Bill 
inserts the slide into the tray of the Projector. 
He clicks the advance button and --
Gah-guh!
Carousel Tray rotates. 
THE OLD MAP OF DERRY is overlayed with the Sewer Map. 
                        BILL (CONT’D)
            Look. Th-there’s the Ironworks. 
            There’s the Black Spot. Everywhere 
            It happened is all connected by the 
            sewers and they all meet up at... 
                                                                 68.

                        BEN
            The wellhouse. 
                        STANLEY
            It’s in the house on Neibolt 
            street... 
Eddie takes a puff off his inhaler.
                        RICHIE
            You mean that creepy ass house 
            where all the junkies and hobos 
            like to sleep?
                        BEVERLY
            I hate that place. It always feels 
            like it’s watching you.
                        BILL
            That’s where It lives. 
Eddie goes over to the Sewer Map and rips it off the wall.
                        EDDIE
            Can we stop talking about this? 
            This is summer -- we’re kids -- 
            we’re supposed to be -- 
                        RICHIE
            I agree with Eds - 
                        BILL
            No put the map back -- 
Gah-guh!
Projector Tray rotates. So it’s back to being a WHITE SQUARE 
OF LIGHT shining on Eddie. No more Map of Derry. 
                        BILL (CONT’D)
            What happened? 
Gah-guh! 
Rotates again. 
Gah-guh! And again. Gah-guh! Gah-guh! 
Mike tries to stop it. 
Suddenly, OLD VACATION SLIDES FROM ACADIA NATIONAL PARK 
APPEAR. The Denbrough Family in Happier Times. 
When Georgie was still alive. 
                                                                 69.

There they are hiking. There they are swimming. There Georgie 
is on the edge of the lake. There he is again. 
And again. Same photo. Again. Waitaminute... 
Gah-guh! Gah-guh! 
The Carousel continues to spin. That same slide. But now it 
looks as if Georgie is moving. 
Bit by bit. And the entire scene is becoming animated. 
Ripples in the lake. Georgie turning to camera. 
An expression of pure fear on his face --
                        BILL (CONT’D)
            Georgie?
                        RICHIE
            What the fuck? 
Gah-guh! Gah-guh!
Georgie runs toward camera. 
                        BEVERLY
            Turn it off... 
Gah-guh!
No one moves. Fixed on this event. 
                        BEVERLY (CONT’D)
            Turn it off!
As Georgie continues to run -- no sound -- but his mouth 
screaming for help -- as he looks back toward the lake and -- 
What’s he see? 
Stanley goes over and pulls out the cord. 
Gah-guh! 
That doesn’t do shit. 
                        BILL
            Georgie!
Gah-guh! Georgie runs off of frame. Gah-guh! As the thing he 
was running from appears. Gah-GODDAMNIT -- 
It’s Pennywise. In the middle of the lake. Standing on water. 
Waving. At camera. At the Losers. At Us.
                                                                 70.

                        RICHIE
            Holy shit... 
                        STANLEY
            That’s It. That’s him. 
Carousel spins faster and faster, which makes Pennywise’s 
wave smoother and smoother until -- in the span of a click --
Pennywise appears right up against camera. Losers SCREAM. 
Mike kicks the boxes and the Carousel crashes to the ground. 
No more Pennywise on the wall. Phew... 
                        STANLEY (CONT’D)
            How’d that even happen? 
                        EDDIE
            It saw us. It knows who we are now. 
                        BILL
            It always did... 
                        BEN
            At least he’s gone now.  
                        BEVERLY
            Uh, guys? 
                        MIKE
            Yeah but for how long? 
                        BEVERLY
            Guys? 
                        BILL
            We need to -- 
                        BEVERLY
            GUYS!
They look over at Beverly. She’s staring at something above 
them. They follow her gaze up to the 
CEILING
To where the Carousel is now projecting. With more space 
between it and the ceiling, the square frame is bigger now. 
And so is Pennywise. Staring down at them with a freeze-frame 
snarl. Until -- 
He POPS OUT of frame. 
                                                                 71.

Fast at first -- but then almost in slow-motion -- as if he’s 
diving into the frigid waters of our reality. 
He reaches out toward Beverly -- 
She falls to the floor to try and distance herself but it 
isn’t going to help. He’s just about to grab her when --
GARAGE DOOR OPENS. 
Flooding the room with light which in turn makes Pennywise 
disappear. The Losers look over at -- 
Ben. By the Garage Door Opener. 
                        BEVERLY (CONT’D)
            Thanks, Ben. Good thinking.
He walks over to her. Helps Beverly get back on her feet. 
Stanley looks over at Richie. His face pale, his mouth open, 
his mind blown, his fear palpable. 
                        STANLEY
            No jokes this time, Rich? 
Richie shakes his head. Doesn’t have anything to say. For the 
first time in his life. Uneasy silence broken by -- 
                        BILL
            Okay so... Let’s go. 
                        BEN
            Go? Where? 
                        BILL
            Neibolt. That’s where Georgie is... 
            We have to go... 
                        STANLEY
            After that? No. No way. 
                        RICHIE
            Yeah, I’m with Stanley. 
                        BILL
            Fine. Then don’t.
                        MIKE
            Wait --  Bill -- 
But he doesn’t wait. Bill hops onto his bike. 
                                                                 72.

                        BILL
            That thing took my brother. I’m 
            going... 
He takes off. 

EXT. 29 NEIBOLT STREET - LATER
Bill hops off his bike and stares at the house. A little less 
brave now that he’s there. As he walks -- 
                        BILL
            He th-thrusts his fists against the 
            posts and still insists...
A LONE BIRD SQUAWKS across the sky somewhere overhead. 
Startles him. He stops. Regards the house. 
Not sure he can do this. 
                        BEVERLY (O.S.)
            Bill!
He looks over. Sees Beverly and the rest of the Losers ride 
into view. They skid to a stop beside him. 
                        BEVERLY (CONT’D)
            You can’t go in there. This is 
            crazy... Someone could get hurt.
Eddie puffs his inhaler. His eyes locked on the porch. Where 
he saw Pennywise earlier. 
                        BILL
            I already said you don’t have to 
            come in with me. But what happens 
            when another Georgie goes missing? 
            Or another Dorsey? Or one of us? 
            Are you just going to pretend it 
            isn’t happening like everyone else 
            in this town? Because I can’t. Even 
            if I wanted to I can’t -- I go home 
            and all I see is that Georgie isn’t 
            there. His clothes, his toys, his 
            stupid stuffed animals but 
            Georgie... He isn’t.... 
                (points to Neibolt)
            So walking into that house...  For 
            me it’s easier than walking into my 
            own... 
He trudges up to 29 Neibolt. His speech settles in. 
                                                                 73.

                        RICHIE
            Wow... 
                        BEN
            What? 
                        RICHIE
            He didn’t even stutter once. 
Richie follows him. Soon, they all do. 

EXT. NEIBOLT HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - MOMENTS LATER 
At the windows, the Losers cup their hands around their 
faces, trying to get a sense of what awaits them inside but -- 
                        RICHIE
            -- I can’t see shit. 
Bill steps back and over to the Front Door. 
Reaches out for the KNOB as a breeze blows -- an unnatural 
one? -- and -- clack! -- door unlatches. 
He looks back at the others. They’re all staring at the door. 
Wondering what’s beyond. 
Freaked out, Eddie takes another puff off his inhaler. Richie 
grabs it from him and does the same. He coughs. Gross...  
                        RICHIE (CONT’D)
            Tastes like battery acid. 
Eddie snatches it back. 
As Bill is about to push open the door -- 
                        MIKE
            Wait. 
They look at him. 
Mike steps off the porch and picks up a broken wrought-iron 
FENCE ROD. Holds it like a weapon. 
Good idea. 
They all scatter and search 
IN THE YARD
A brick, a sharp-ended stick, whatever they can find. Richie 
picks up an empty BEER BOTTLE and smashes it against a rock.
                                                                 74.

Just like they do in the movies. 
Harder than it looks. 
And when he does finally manage to break it, it just shatters 
to a million, useless little pieces. 
He looks to Mike: 
                        RICHIE
            I’ll just stand behind you. 
MOMENTS LATER 
The Losers reunite on the Front Porch. Nod to Bill: Okay, now 
or never...
Bill pushes the Front Door OPEN and takes us inside.

INT. NEIBOLT HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Condoms, Candy Wrappers, and Cigarette Butts litter the 
floor. Old Magazines and Newspapers stacked so high it’s like 
they’re holding up the second floor. 
And Graffiti. It’s everywhere.
Screw Derry. Just Say Yes. Class of Who the Fuck Cares.
Everything about this place feels like a nest made by junkies  
and serial killers. Shredded carpet. Broken Furniture. 
The Losers take it all in. 
                        BEVERLY
            This place stinks. I can smell it.
                        MIKE
            I smell it too.
                        RICHIE
            Don’t breath through your mouth.
                        BEVERLY
            Why?
                        RICHIE
            ‘Cause then you’re eating it.
He picks up a water-stained MAGAZINE. It’s Famous Monsters of 
Filmland. On the cover, a Werewolf.  
                                                                 75.

Beverly sees an OLD LANTERN on one of the shelves. Right next 
to a dismembered Doll. She tries turning it on. 
It flickers to fluorescent life.
                        BEN
            If there’s a well here it’d have to 
            be in the basement, right? 
                        STANLEY
            Does this place even have a 
            basement?
                        EDDIE
            I hope not.
                        BILL
            L-let’s find out. 
He moves toward the kitchen BUT FROM UPSTAIRS -- 
                        CHILD’S VOICE (O.S.)
            Hello? Is someone here? 
Eyes shoot up to the ceiling above them. Ben looks over at 
Bill and wonders softly -- 
                        BEN
            Georgie? 
Bill shakes his head: No...
                        CHILD’S VOICE (O.S.)
            HELLO?!
Over to the foot of the stairs -- 
                        BEVERLY
            Down here! We’re down here!
We SLOWLY PUSH UP the steps. 
Leaving the Losers’ behind as we drift down the 
UPSTAIRS HALLWAY
Rotted, water-stained wallpaper with elves on it peels like 
dead skin from scummy walls. Ripped orange carpet.
As we approach the FAR CORNER, we begin to hear from just 
around the other side, a LOW FREQUENCY BUZZ. 
BZZZZzzzzzzZZZZZZzzzzzz.... 
                                                                 76.

It’s unsettling. 
And growing louder the closer we get. 
From around the corner -- 
                        CHILD’S VOICE (O.S.)
            Help me, please...  
FOOTSTEPS. 
Up the stairs. 
                        BILL (O.S.)
            Wait -- Bev -- 
We spin around and see Beverly standing at the top of the 
steps. The Other Losers cram themselves around her.
                        BILL (CONT’D)
            We need to be cautious. 
                        CHILD’S VOICE (O.S.)
            Hello? 
They move down the hall.
Floorboards creeeeak and grooaaaan under them as they each 
take steps. As if any moment the floor might give way. 
Which it will. But not yet.  
The Losers look into the Bio-Hazard Bedrooms as they pass. 
Nearing the Corner at the end of the Hall. 
                        MIKE
            You guys hear that? 
They listen. 
To that slightest bzzzzzZZZZZZzzzzzZZZZZZzzzzzzZZZZZZ. 
As they make the turn and -- oh, it’s -- 
ANOTHER HALLWAY
A nearby corroding PLUG the source of the buzz. 
The Losers continue on
Fixated on That Door at the End of the Hallway. 
But behind them, 
                                                                 77.

SqueakSqueakSqueak...
They turn. 
Shit.
Pennywise. 
Pedaling an old, rusted tricycle. 
Its front wheel bent. 
SqueakSqueakSqueak... 
He stops.  
Right by the plug. 
Losers press themselves up against the wall. Each grab hold 
of the other standing next to them. 
                        EDDIE
            Oh shit oh shit oh shit... 
Buries his face into Richie’s shoulder. Can’t look.
                        BILL
            WHERE’S G-G-GEORGIE?! 
                        PENNYWISE
                (in the Child’s Voice)
            Who’s Geor-- oh -- sor--
                (in normal voice)
            -ry, who’s Georgie? 
He LAUGHS. Eyes the children. Counting... 
                        PENNYWISE (CONT’D)
            Boymeat. Boymeat. BoymeatBoymeat. 
            BoymeatBoymeat... 
                (ooh, Beverly)
            Girlmeat. Yes. Sweet, salty 
            bloodgorged girlmeat...
He inches forward, breathing in deep.
                        PENNYWISE (CONT’D)
            Use your thin blue veins like 
            straws, little ears like spoons...
That plug SPARKS. Pennywise looks over at it. Ahem. 
                                                                 78.

                        PENNYWISE (CONT’D)
            Armpits and cowlicks, freckles and 
            dimples, peachy fuzz, scabbed 
            knees, squeals and screams...
Spark BUZZES. Pennywise presses on, ignoring it.  
                        PENNYWISE (CONT’D)
            They all reek so goo-- 
BUZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.
Pennywise stops. Considers the plug. He pulls out the TINIEST 
SCREWDRIVER EVER from his coat. 
Kneels and tightens the plug screws. But the buzzing 
continues. But then -- light bulb! -- a better idea. 
From his sleeve, Pennywise yanks out A BIGGER SCREWDRIVER. 
Like ridiculously big. Like it was bought at ACME. 
And this --
HE JAMS INTO THE SOCKET. 
Electricity surges through Pennywise. His collar smokes. Hair 
catches fire. He laughs, maniacal. 
An EXPLOSION of SPARKS, revealing -- 
Pennywise has transformed into a gruesome creature. His 
bulging eyes big but his toothy demonic grin even bigger.
He LUNGES for the kids. They SCREAM and scatter. 
As they run, the floor gives out behind them. Below is just a 
pit of blackness. It divides the Group from -- 
EDDIE
Teetering on the edge, he turns. About to fall in. But a HAND 
reaches out and grabs him. Pulls him upright.  
Eddie relieved. 
Until he looks down at the hand holding him -- oozing with 
open sores -- and we PAN UP to reveal it’s the hand of -- 
                        HOBO
            Hi, Eds. 
Eddie faints. 
Falls. 
                                                                 79.

Through the hole. 
We go with him, landing hard somewhere in blackness. 
His arm SNAPS. 
He SCREAMS.
                        EDDIE
            My arm!
ABOVE HIM, 
Beverly trips and her lantern rolls off the edge. 
Lands beside Eddie. 
Light still on, illuminating the 
KITCHEN
Windows blacked out with tinfoil and newspaper. 
Eddie Tries to get to his feet but MORE DEBRIS falls on top 
of him. Pinning him down by the old, busted REFRIGERATOR. 
UPSTAIRS HALLWAY
The Losers SCRAMBLE, trying to find a way out. Monstrous 
Pennywise has disappeared. They realize -- 
                        RICHIE
            Eds! We need to get to Eddie!
IN THE KITCHEN 
Using his good arm, Eddie tries to dig himself out from under 
the pile that has him pinned. Faster and faster as -- 
Refrigerator Door OPENS, revealing -- 
Pennywise. 
Contorted into the impossibly small space. He unfolds and 
untangles himself from inside the refrigerator. 
He straightens. 
Reaches down and grabs hold of Richie’s Broken Arm.
Nearby, A DOOR OPENS. 
An Orange glow pulsates inside, illuminating a set of stairs 
leading down to the Basement of Neibolt. 
                                                                 80.

Nothing good happens down there. 
                        PENNYWISE
            Time to float. 
Pennywise drags Eddie toward the Basement Door. 
Eddie SCREAMS some more. 
Behind them -- 
The Losers appear in the Kitchen. 
United. 
They grab hold of Eddie. Trying to pull him back from 
Pennywise. Pennywise opens his mouth, snarling. 
Richie grabs Eddie’s Inhaler from his holster. 
                        RICHIE
            Try some battery acid, asshole!
PUFFS the Inhaler in Pennywises’ Face. The Clown SCREECHES. 
Like it’s burning through his skin. He lets go of Eddie. 
Allowing the Losers to pull Eddie away as Mike throws the 
Fence Post at Pennywise. SPIKES him in the chest. 
The Losers haul ass back into the Living Room. 
                        BEVERLY
            GO! RUN! 

EXT. 29 NEIBOLT STREET - DAY 
Richie’s pulled out and the kids stumble through the 
sunflowers to their bikes. Away from Neibolt, the whole house 
seeming to laugh at them from behind... 
As Eddie balances himself on Ben’s bike, Ben looks over. Sees 
Beverly wrapping her arms around Bill as they ride together. 

EXT. EDDIE’S HOUSE - LATER 
Mrs. Kaspbrak shoves Eddie into the back seat, hysterical.
                        MRS. KASPBRACK
            You.  You did this!
She slams the door on Eddie and fumbles for her keys.
                                                                 81.

                        MRS. KASPBRAK
            You know how delicate he is.
                        BILL
            We were attacked, Mrs. K.--
                        MRS. KASPBRACK
            Don’t!  Don’t even try to blame 
            someone else...  
Mrs. Kaspbrack pulls out all sorts of garbage from her purse 
until she finds the keys, dropping them.  
                        BEVERLY
            Let me help.
She smacks Beverly away.
                        MRS. KASPBRACK
            Back! Get back!  What’s a little 
            girl even doing with a gang of boys 
            like this.  If I was your mother 
            I’d be sick. Sick!
                        WILL
            Mrs. K, I swear--
                        MRS. KASPBRAK
            No!  You’re monsters.  Reckless, 
            selfish monsters.  Eddie’s done 
            with you, you hear!  Done.  
She jumps into the front seat and turns the engine. 
                        MRS. KASPBRAK (CONT’D)
            I don’t want to see any of your 
            faces ever again!
She slams the door and the car squeals out of the driveway. 
Bill and the kids stand all rag tag there, low and shaken.

EXT. KANSAS STREET - LATER
Bill, Richie, Beverly, Stanley, Ben and Mike walk along. 
                        BILL
            We’ll need to go back. Prepared 
            this time...
                        STANLEY
            You’re crazy... 
                                                                 82.

                        BEVERLY
            Why? He’s right. No one else is 
            going to do anything.
                        RICHIE
            Eddie was nearly killed! By some 
            shape shifting demon monster that 
            almost used my guts for garters... 
                        MIKE
            But we hurt it. That’s something.
                        BEN
            Great, so next time it will just be 
            madder and bigger and not mess 
            around to kill us.
                        BEVERLY
            We can’t pretend it’s going to go 
            away. Because it’s not. Ever. You 
            know that, you did your research -- 
                        BEN
            So I’ll go away and not come back. 
            Not my problem anymore. You can’t 
            wait to get out of this town either 
            you said --
                        BEVERLY
            -- because I want to run towards 
            something. Not run away. That’s 
            what cowards do... 
Ouch. Burn. Ben. 
                        RICHIE
            Oh who invited you into the group 
            anyway? Let’s face facts. Real 
            world. Georgie is dead. Stop trying 
            to get us all killed just like you 
            got him killed... 
A deep cut. Richie moves to go. Bill blocks him.
                        BILL
            I didn’t get my brother killed-
                        RICHIE
            Out of my way, Bill. You couldn’t 
            save him but you can still save 
            yourself... 
                                                                 83.

                        BILL
            T-T-T-Take it back! You’re scared. 
            We all are. But take that back!
They start shoving each other. Shoves turn to punches. A 
pounding of pent up anger, pent up fear. Bill lands a heavy 
blow and Richie falls to the ground hard. 
He gets up. His face stings red. 
                        RICHIE
            You’re just a bunch of losers and 
            you’ll get yourselves killed trying 
            to stop this stupid killer, when 
            none of it makes any difference.
Richie and Bill start to go at it again but Mike and Ben step 
in to separate them.  Ben checks Bill to the pavement.
Beverly pushes Ben away. 
                        BEVERLY
            What are you doing! Stop! 
She drops to Bill’s side. Ben is crushed.  
                        BEN
            Richie’s right. Bill doesn’t care 
            about anybody but himself.  We all 
            have shit too.  I’m sick of it.
He and Stanley help Richie up.
                        BEVERLY 
            This is what It wants. It wants us 
            divided... That’s what it was doing 
            in Neibolt... Separating us... 
                        RICHIE
            Well It got what it wants. But at 
            least I’m alive. And I plan on 
            staying that way... 
Richie, Ben and Stanley go. Bill looks to Beverly and Mike.  
Mike splits off from them too.
                        BEVERLY
            Mike, wait... 
                        MIKE
            No. I can’t do this. I should have 
            listened to my grandfather. I’m an 
            outsider, I need to stay that -- 
                                                                 84.

                        BILL
            But we’re all outsiders -- 
                        MIKE
            No. You’re not. 
He walks away. Leaving only Bill and Bev. 

EXT. DERRY - VARIOUS - DAY
Warehouse Row. City Center. Memorial Park. A LONE PATROL CAR 
creeps down West Broadway, passing the Synagogue. 

INT. SYNAGOGUE - CONTINUOUS
Stanley is reaching the Dvar Torah part of his Bar Mitzvah 
ceremony, nervously finishing a verse from a scroll.  
                        STANLEY
            ...may’ansho sheh’la’zeh.
He glances up at his mom, who refuses to smile. At Richie 
seated in the back. And then at the Rabbi. Who nods: Go on.. 
                        STANLEY (CONT’D)
            Um, reflecting on what I just read, 
            I like what it says about 
            indifference. When you’re a kid... 
His eyes fall on the empty seats next to Richie. Rattles him.
                        RABBI
            Stanley. 
                        STANLEY
            Well, when you’re a kid you think 
            the universe revolves around you. 
            That you’ll always be protected and 
            cared for. Then one day something 
            bad happens and you realize that’s 
            not true...  

EXT. HANLON ABBATOIR - CONTINUOUS 
A SHEEP stands in its pen. Separated from its flock. Leroy 
hands Mike the Stunbolt Gun. Like, let’s try this again... 
                                                                 85.

                        STANLEY (O.S.)
            Suns go out and animals go extinct 
            and whole nations go crazy and kill 
            a people they don’t like and none 
            of it seems to matter.
Mike aims the Stunbolt. Whompf. Sheep falls dead. 

EXT. BEVERLY’S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
Beverly brushes her hair. Her eyes spot the smallest fleck of 
blood on one of the tiles. She can’t look away. 
                        STANLEY (O.S.)
            That’s why our friends and faith 
            and family are so important. 

INT. WILL’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Will sits at the dinner table. Eating alone.
                        STANLEY (O.S.)
            We matter. Even if, to the 
            universe...

INT. DERRY PUBLIC LIBRARY - READING ROOM - DAY 
Ben looks up at a PAINTING of the First Derry Settlement. At 
first it appears like the Fur Trappers are on the hunt, lying 
in the prone position. But closer inspection reveals -- 
                        RICHIE (O.S.)
            ...we’re too small to notice.
They’re dead. Because Whatever they were hunting found them 
instead. And as we PUSH IN on that WELLHOUSE we CUT TO: 
TITLE CARD over the PENOBSCOT RIVER:
                   AUGUST 
Tilt down to the OVERHEAD shot of what we expect to be “Derry 
1989”, but instead we see NOTHING, just the intersection of a 
stream and river and the surrounding wilderness, towering 
black pines as far as the eye can see.  
This is Derry in -- 
                                                                 86.
                          1637

INT. WELLHOUSE - NIGHT 
ABIGAIL, 19. Rushes in and SLAMS the door. As if trying to 
keep Satan himself out. She clutches her BABY to her breast. 
Kneels by DYING EMBERS in the hearth. She blows on ‘em but a 
flame never catches. Her Baby starts to fuss... 
                        ABIGAIL
            Hush now, shhhh... it’ll be -- 
She stops. 
Realizes that the SMALL CANDLE CHANDELIER slowly spins above 
her. As if some unnatural force has caused its light to 
rotate around the room, like tiny primitive searchlights. 
She hears something slithering in the gray shadows by the 
Well. Occasionally we catch glimpses of a BLACK SILHOUETTE.  
Shifting its shape. As if trying to decide on a form. 
                        ABIGAIL (CONT’D)
            Please, Devil... leave us be... 
Shape shifts again. 
A beam of light passes, revealing PENNYWISE, naked, lithe, 
flesh pale and translucent, a half- formed imitation of a 
human, opens his maw full of large razor sharp teeth, 
dripping with saliva.
As the Tin Can spins clockwise, Pennywise moves counter 
around the room. Each time the light hits his face -- 
It’s different. 
A Man. A Woman. A Beast. A Monster. Tim Curry. 
                        PENNYWISE
            You mistake me woman. No mere 
            devil, I am the Eater of Worlds.
His voice is guttural, unnatural.
                        ABIGAIL
            But my child, not my child... He is 
            innocent... 
                                                                 87.

                        PENNYWISE
            So you say. 
The Baby SCREAMS. Pennywise smiles. 
                        PENNYWISE (CONT’D)
            Beautiful fear... 
                        ABIGAIL
            I pray Thee, take me. 
Abigail shuffles back. 
                        PENNYWISE
            I will. And then, him. And thy  
            husband and the rest of thy
            children, and all the savages who
            brought you here. And when you all
            rot in the earth, I will pick thy
            bones dry until no meat is left to
            pick. And then I will seek out thy
            bones and consume thy souls until
            nothing is left but the weeds!
            (beat)
            Or you will occupy yourself 
            otherwise and not interfere. I will 
            take her and you will live, and 
            those of thy other children -- in 
            whom I take no interest. And you 
            will thank ME fever and frost did 
            not damn you to the soil.
Abigail looks down at her baby again. She’s shaking, doesn’t 
want to let go. Behind her, the Door OPENS. 
A Little Boy, 6, asks -- 
                        BOY
            Mama? 
                        ABIGAIL
            NO! OUT! NOW!
Frightened by his mother, the Boy runs. 
Abigail turns back to Pennywise. Wherever he may be now in 
the room. The light somehow seems to spin faster now. 
She kisses her baby and sets it down. It BAWLS. 
                        ABIGAIL (CONT’D)
            I’m sorry, I’m so sorry... 
                                                                 88.

She turns away from the baby. Faces those dying embers. We 
keep on her face as they seem to begin GLOWING BRIGHTER AS -- 
OVER HER SHOULDER -- OUT OF FOCUS -- 
Pennywise crawls over to the Baby and starts to feast. SHARP 
CRY FROM THE BABY CUT OFF as we hear a CRUNCH. 
Abigail continues to look into the BRIGHT ORANGE GLOW of not 
the flickering fire...
...but the DEADLIGHTS. 
Her expression changing.  Fear. Denial. Grief. Acceptance.  
And then nothing. Just a glazed look. 
AS IF NOTHING HORRIFIC IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING BEHIND HER. 

EXT. TRAVIS BOWER’S BACKYARD - DAY
BLAM! Of a gun. 
A bottle of Southern Comfort sits on a log. 
Travis shoots at it with his dad’s police issue .45. Victor 
and Snatch look on, giggling.
He finally tags it, the bottle shattering into a thousand 
pieces.  They all whoop and holler.
                        SNATCH
            Can I try?
He reaches for the gun.  Bowers pushes him back.
                        TRAVIS
            Sure.  Go put the next target out 
            there.
Travis points to the cat that’s lounging there in the grass.
                        SNATCH
            You’re foolin’ right?
                        TRAVIS
            Do I look like I’m foolin’?
Snatch grabs the kitty and runs out to the stump. He wipes 
away the glass and sets the cat down. It starts to meow and 
tries to get away.
                        TRAVIS (CONT’D)
            Just hold it.
                                                                 89.

Bower lines up a shot, sight of the barrel on the cat. Finger 
pressing the trigger-
                        SNATCH
            Wait!
                        OFFICER BOWERS (O.C.)
            What the hell is this?
Officer Bowers steps from his police cruiser in the driveway. 
His face as red as fire.
                        TRAVIS
            Nothing, pa.  Just cleaning your 
            gun like you asked.
                        OFFICER BOWERS
            Cleaning my gun, huh?
He stalks up and grabs the gun from Travis. Smells it. 
WHAP! He smacks Travis hard in the face, knocking the big boy 
to the grass.  Butch turns the gun on Travis at his feet.
                        OFFICER BOWERS (CONT’D)
            You’re not worth the salt you lick, 
            boy.  I don’t know how God spanked 
            life into you.
                        TRAVIS
            Pa, I’m---
BLAM! 
He shoots the ground around Travis’ feet. Travis squeals like 
a girl, utterly terrified.  BLAM!  BLAM!  A large wet stain 
spreads around his crotch.  Butch Bowers raises the pistol, 
as if he were about to whip Travis, who falls to the ground.
Butch shakes his head.
                        OFFICER BOWERS
                (to the boys)
            Look at him now boys.  Nothing like 
            a little fear to make a paper man 
            crumble.
                (to Travis)
            Clean your drawers ‘fore you come 
            inside.
He spits out his disgust, stalks inside.
BELLS RING -- 
                                                                 90.

INT. KEENE’S PHARMACY - DAY 
-- above the door as Eddie enters, his arm still in a cast. 
He sees Greta at the Cash Register reading a SEVENTEEN 
MAGAZINE. She watches him, amused. Because she’s bored. 
                        MR. KEENE
            Here for the refills, Eddie? 
Eddie nods. Mr. Keene sighs and disappears in the back. Once 
they’re alone --
                        GRETA
            No friends, huh? 
Eddie looks around. She talking to me? 
                        GRETA (CONT’D)
            Your cast. No signatures or 
            anything... So sad. 
Eddie looks down at his cast. White. Plain. And yeah, sad. 
                        EDDIE
            I didn’t want to get it dirty... 
Greta leans on the counter. Casts a quick look over to the 
back counter. Where her father could appear any minute. 
                        GRETA
            You know it’s all bullshit.
                        EDDIE
            Um, what is? 
                        GRETA
            Your medication. They’re placebos. 
                        EDDIE
            What does placebo mean? 
Greta shakes her head. This kid just doesn’t get it...
                        GRETA
            Placebo means bullshit. Just what I 
            said...  
                        MR. KEENE (O.S.)
            Okay, here we are Mr. Kaspbrak...  
Eddie looks over as Mr. Keene comes back with his Medication.
Ringggg.... Rinnggg.... 
                                                                 91.

INT. BEVERLY’S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Rrrrrrin-- 
Beverly picks up the phone. 
                        BEVERLY
            Hello? 
                        BILL
                (on phone)
            Hey. It’s me. 
Beverly smiles. But still --
                        BEVERLY
            You know not to call me here... 
            What happened to our signal?
INTERCUT:

INT. BILL’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Bill stands at his desk. Below him through the floorboards, 
we can just make out his parents arguing. 
                        BILL
            You answered before I could hang 
            up. You okay? 
                        BEVERLY
            I’m fine. 
                        BILL
            Y-you hear from anyone? 
                        BEVERLY
            No. You? 
Bill doesn’t answer. Doesn’t need to... 
                        BILL
            Feel like doing something? I d-
            don’t like you being alone...
                        BEVERLY
            I don’t like you being alone 
            either... 
As they talk, we drift out of the Bedroom and down the 
Hallway and into the 
KITCHEN
                                                                 92.

To find Mr. Marsh listening on the other line. 
                        BEVERLY (CONT’D)
            Usual spot? Ten minutes? 
                        BILL
            See you then. 
He hangs up. 

EXT. TRAVIS BOWER’S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS
Travis does everything he can not to cry.
                        VICTOR
            You okay, Travis?
An odd wind stirs through the grass there, a yellow menacing 
gathering of clouds overhead. Travis suddenly notices... 
A BALLOON, bobbing over his mailbox, string connected to 
something stuffed inside.
Travis pushes past his two cronies and goes over to the 
mailbox. Inside he pulls out THE RAMBO KNIFE. The one he lost 
at the beginning.
A murderous look screws onto Travis’ face as he turns his 
attention to his house. And his Dad inside. Travis snaps the 
string and starts toward the front door with the knife.   
The Balloon rises up. 

INT. BEVERLY’S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Beverly stands in front of the mirror, buttoning up her 
shirt. Freezes when she sees behind her --  
Creeeeeeaaaak. 
Of her Bedroom Door as it opens. In the reflection, she can 
see her Father standing at the threshold. 
                        BEVERLY
            H-Hi, Daddy... 
                        MR. MARSH
            You’re looking prettied up, Bevvie. 
                        BEVERLY
            I’m not prettied up, Daddy. I wear 
            this almost every day...
                                                                 93.

                        MR. MARSH
            Who was that you was talkin’ to 
            just now? 
                        BEVERLY
            A friend.
Mr. Marsh enters the room. 
                        MR. MARSH
            Is that the boy you been running 
            around with?
                        BEVERLY
            He’s just a friend.
Mr. Marsh sits on the edge of her bed. 
                        MR. MARSH
            Well come over here, give your 
            daddy a minute.
She reluctantly goes over. Gives him a kiss. He snatches her 
wrist as she pulls away.
                        MR. MARSH (CONT’D)
            You know I worry about you, Bevvie.  
            I worry a lot.
                        BEVERLY
            I know daddy.
She tries to go, but he holds on to her wrist.
                        MR. MARSH
            People in town got to saying some 
            things to me.  About you.  Sneakin’ 
            around all summer long with a pack 
            of boys. Only girl to the pack. 
                        BEVERLY
            They’re just friends Daddy, I 
            swear...
                        MR. MARSH
            I know what’s in them boy’s minds 
            when they look at you, Bevvie. All 
            too well...
He squeezes harder. It begins to hurt.
                        BEVERLY
            Daddy, my hand--
                                                                 94.

                        MR. MARSH
            Your ma says you’re a woman now.  
            What’s that mean? You been doing 
            womanly things down in the woods 
            with those boys? 
He jerks her closer to him, proprietary.
                        BEVERLY
            Nothing. Please, daddy. You don’t 
            have to worry. I promise.
                        MR. MARSH
            No?  What’s this?
He pulls out Ben’s Postcard.
                        BEVERLY
            It’s nothing. Just a poem.
                        MR. MARSH
            A poem? You squirreled it away in 
            your undies drawer.  Why would you 
            want to hide it there, Bevvie?  
He looks at her legs.
                        MR. MARSH (CONT’D)
            Slip down them shorts. 
                        BEVERLY
            What?
                        MR. MARSH
            I need you to prove to me you’re 
            still mine...
Beverly tries to resist. 
                        BEVERLY
            No... 
                        MR. MARSH
            C’mere... 
                        BEVERLY
            No! Daddy!
Bev wrestles away, falling back and smacking her head on the 
floor.  She starts crabbing away on her back down the hall.  
Her dad lunges on top of her.
                                                                 95.

                        MR. MARSH,
            Them little boys, Bevvie. Do they 
            know you’re my -- 
Bev knees him in the balls. Her father lets go, crumpling 
down. She kicks him in the face as hard as she can, his head 
flying back into the side of the door.
Beverly tries to race out the door but he snatches her ankle 
and she trips into the hallway. By the time she is up he is 
already charging after her. She stumbles back into the 
BATHROOM
and shuts the door, trying to lock herself inside. He kicks 
the door open before the lock catches. 
Without thinking Bev grabs the toilet top and smashes it in 
her dad’s crown. He slumps down. Unconscious. Suddenly -- 
From the Faucet. From the Shower. Between cracks in the tile.
BLOOD. 
Gushes everywhere. 
Beverly runs back into the 
HALLWAY
Pennywise stands there. Balloons in hand. Beverly realizes 
she has nowhere to go. Pennywise releases the balloons. They 
float up and POP!POP!POP! as they hit the ceiling. 
BLOOD bursting out of them. 

INT. TRAVIS BOWER’S HOUSE - DAY
The front door creaks open, Victor and Snatch poking their 
heads in... 
                        SNATCH
            Travis?
                        VICTOR
            Mr. Bowers?
Nothing. They see a streak of blood on the floor that leads 
to the KITCHEN and Butch Bowers on the linoleum floor in a 
red pool, stabbed dozens of times. 
                        SNATCH
            Holy fuck.
                                                                 96.

Victor vomits. 
The cat slips in and starts licking up the blood.
                        SNATCH (CONT’D)
            Travis, dude, you okay?
Snatch continues on into the LIVING ROOM where he finds 
TRAVIS sitting in Butch’s favorite Lazy-boy in front of the 
TV, which is turned on to PENNYWISE THE CLOWN SHOW.  
He holds the knife, slicked in blood, his eyes glazed. He 
turns and looks at Snatch and Victor in the doorway. 
                        TRAVIS
            It’s my knife now.

EXT. DERRY STANDPIPE - DAY 
On his bike, Bill makes endless figure eights. He keeps 
looking in the same direction. Waiting for Beverly. He checks 
his watch. Makes a decision. 

INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY/BEVERLY’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
Bill sees the Front Door ajar. Pushes it open, revealing all 
the blood. And Mr. Marsh. Knocked out on the floor. 
                        BILL
            BEVERLY! BEVERLY!
Searching... searching... 
Inside
BEVERLY’S BEDROOM
Right above her bed. Scrawled in blood. 
                      YOU’LL DIE IF YOU TRY! 
Bill races out of the room. 
                                                      CUT TO THE:
FINAL FIGHT.  
The side-scrolling Arcade Game, I mean. 
Richie plays, kicking and punching away his frustration as he  
progresses through the game. We’re inside the
                                                                 97.

ARCADE
Richie is at the ‘FINAL BOSS BATTLE’. 
                        RICHIE
            Finally! Anyone wanna watch me -- 
                        BILL (O.S.)
            RICHIE!
Bill races over as the Final Boss Fight BEGINS. 
                        BILL (CONT’D)
            It got Beverly. 
Richie looks at Bill, a moment between them. 
                        RICHIE
            I’ll call Eddie and Stanley. You 
            get Ben and Mike... We’ll meet up 
            at the standpipe. 
                        BILL
            Th-thanks. 
                        RICHIE
            Hey, what are friends for, right? 
Richie and Bill leave. As we pan back to FINAL FIGHT to find 
Richie’s Player ‘CODY’ getting the shit kicked out of him. 
Hope that isn’t a sign of things to come. 
Probably is, though. 

INT. KASPBRAK HOUSE, EDDIE’S BEDROOM - DAY 
Eddie on the phone with Richie --
                        EDDIE
            Meet you there. 
He hangs up. Stares at himself in the mirror. Can he do this? 
He can do this. About to go -- 
But Mrs. Kaspbarak enters. Licks her fingers clean of 
whatever she was eating earlier. Probably lots of things. 
                        MRS. KASPBRAK
            And just where do you think you’re 
            going off to?
                        EDDIE
            Out with my friends.  
                                                                 98.

                        MRS. KASPBRAK
            No sweetie, you can’t go. You’re 
            still getting over your sickness, 
            remember? 
                        EDDIE
            My sickness? What sickness, Ma? 
He goes over to his closet. Pulls out the Plastic Bag he got 
at the Pharmacy. Dumps out all the untouched medication.
Mrs. Kaspbrak. Horrified at the sight. 
                        EDDIE (CONT’D)
            Know what these are? They’re 
            placebos! They’re bullshit!
                        MRS. KASPBRAK
            No, they help you, Eddie. They help 
            me. You were born so early, you 
            were so delicate and fragile that I 
            had to protect you -- 
                        EDDIE
            How can any of this protect me? 
Eddie stops. Realizes: 
                        EDDIE (CONT’D)
            The only people looking out for me 
            were my friends... You made me turn 
            my back on them when I really 
            needed them... But now they need me 
            so I’m going. 
Charges past her and down the stairs. She stands at the top, 
the bulk of her threatening to tumble down. 
                        MRS. KASPBRAK
            EDDIE! EDDIE! YOU GET BACK HERE! 
            DON’T DO THIS TO ME EDDIE!
But Eddie does. Eddie leaves.  

EXT. MONUMENT SQUARE - LATER 
The Losers reunited. Save for one. The serious nature of 
their task weighs on ‘em. Richie sees Mike’s Stunbolt.
                        MIKE
            Better than a broken bottle.
                                                                 99.

                        BILL
            If anyone wants to bow out now... 
                        BEN
            No. Remember what Beverly said. We 
            all go or none of us do... That’s 
            the only way we can defeat It. 
Bill nods. 
                        BILL
            Then let’s go to Neibolt. 
                                                           CUT TO:
OVER BLACK, 
An old DOO-WOP RECORD plays, amplified by distant and crummy 
speakers: You’re my love, you’re my angel, you’re the girl of 
my dream... 
ON BEVERLY
Snaps awake. Where is she? Looks like -- 
A DARK TUNNEL
Made of rubble and rust.
I’d like to thank you for waiting patiently... 
A noise. She turns. At the far end of the tunnel, a SHADOW OF 
MR. MARSH appears on the wall. Nightmarishly exaggerated. 
Daddy’s home... Daddy’s home to stay... 
Beverly stands. Fists clenched. Ready to go round two with 
her father. But then the record begins to slow down as the 
shadow morphs into -- 
A GIANT SPIDER. 
Beverly scrambles the other way at the Spider’s Shadow 
continues to grow. She chances a look back and right when you 
think the Spider is about to turn the corner -- 
It’s Pennywise instead. Making SHADOW PUPPETS with his hands. 
He stops and points behind Beverly -- so scared is he -- 
She spins and sees Pennywise right in her face. 
Beverly falls back, out of reach. He approaches, towering 
over her. Sharp Teeth bared as she cowers. But wait. He 
stops. Something is off. But what?
                                                                100.

CLOSE ON: Beverly’s hand. Fingers curled around rock. 
                        BEVERLY
            I’m not afraid of you. 
WHACK! 
She SMACKS him across the face with the stone. Knocks 
Pennywise aside and takes off running. 
Pennywise rises up. Filled with rage.  

EXT. NEIBOLT HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
The Boys drop their bikes on the lawn. They stare at the 
house that looms before them. This is It. 
As they walk up toward their probable deaths, they fail to 
notice Vic’s Trans Am appear at the end of Neibolt. 
Creeping along, like a lion in tall grass. 

INT. VICTOR’S TRANS AM - CONTINUOUS
Travis slows to a stop. 
                        TRAVIS
            Like lambs to a slaughter, wouldn’t 
            you say fellas? 
He looks over at Victor in the Passenger Seat and Belch in 
the back. They’re both dead. Throats slit into gaping grins. 
                        TRAVIS (CONT’D)
            Yeah, sure you would.  

INT. NEIBOLT HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Front Door opens. Stirs the dimness and dust. They enter.  
                        MIKE
            Where do you think she’ll be?
                        BILL 
            B-Basement. The well. That’s where 
            he was going to take Eds, right? 
He looks over at Eddie. Still at the threshold. Rattled. 
                                                                101.

                        BILL (CONT’D)
            As long as we don’t let fear 
            overtake us we can do it. But we 
            have to do it together... 
Eddie looks past Bill and into the house. Then meets Bill’s 
eyes. Nods. And then enters. 
                                                           CUT TO:

Still running and scrambling, Beverly rounds a sharp corner 
and steps into what Uncle Stevie calls --
THE MACROVERSE
I know it sounds expensive but it isn’t. Picture an ENDLESS 
FIELD OF BLACK. Like space. Or death. Beverly looks behind 
her. No way to turn back. Has to push forward. 

INT. NEIBOLT HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
As the boys investigate further, the house wheezes with its 
creaks and groans. Like it’s been disturbed from sleep. 
BANG! BANG! From the
KITCHEN
Boys hurry in. Something BANG!BANG!BANGS! against the 
Basement Door from the other side. Bill rushes over.
                        EDDIE
            Wait -- no -- 
                        BILL
            It could be her. 
He tries to open the door. But it’s stuck in its frame. The 
Others come over to help and -- BANG! -- it flies open. Boys 
fall back. A DOZEN RED BALLOONS float out from the Basement 
and into the Kitchen. Nothing beyond.  
                        EDDIE
            It isn’t her. It’s him. 
Bill gets to his feet. Deep breath. 
                        BILL
            C’mon. Stay close. 
He steps down into the void. Richie, Eddie and Stanley follow 
right behind him. Stairs shake and wobble with each step. 
                                                                102.

ON BILL
He steps off the stairs -- splish! -- and finds himself 
stepping into inches of water. Because now he’s inside the
SEWER
Intestinal. Exaggerated. Like they were constructed by a 
child’s dark imagination. Bill looks back for the others. But 
they’re gone. Along with the basement stairs. 
                        BILL (CONT’D)
            G-Guys! Hello?! 

INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
Richie, Stanley, Eddie, Ben and Mike steps off into the 
basement. But no sign of Bill. He’s vanished. 
                        EDDIE
            Where’s Bill? We were supposed to 
            stick together... 
                        RICHIE
            BILL? 

INT. SEWER - CONTINUOUS
Bill searches for a way out. Trying to remain calm, trying to 
remain brave -- repeating over and over again -- 
                        BILL
            H-he th-thrust his f-fists into the 
            posts and still insists he s-sees 
            the... 
A SHADOW passes over him. Bill stops.
                        PENNYWISE (O.S.)
            ...g-g-ghosts. 
Bill looks up. Sees Pennywise smiling at Bill through a Sewer 
Grate. Blood drips from his teeth and down onto Bill.
Bill swallows down his fear, stands his ground. Pennywise    
drools, deciding... 
                        PENNYWISE (CONT’D)
            Not yet seasoned. But I know a 
            boymeat that is... 
He laughs and steps away. Off Bill’s ‘oh shit’ look -- 
                                                                103.

INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
The Boys search the shadows of the basement for Bill. Somehow 
it seems more sprawling than the house above them. 
Near Eddie. A ‘did I just hear that?’ WHISPER -- 
                        BILL (O.S.)
            Eddie!
Eddie turns. Where’d that come from? 
                        EDDIE
            Bill? 
He creeps further into shadow. Stops. Senses something off. 
Looks down at his feet as the floor opens up under him.
He drops into a
SMALL ROOM
Like we’re inside a tumor. Walls made of SCABS and SCARS. 
Floor cobbled with WARTS and ULCERS. Eddie groans.
                        EDDIE (CONT’D)
            I think I’m gonna be sick... 
Behind him, the Hobo appears and grabs him. 
                        HOBO
            I already am. 
Eddie SCREAMS. 

INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
Ben turns, realizing -- 
                        BEN
            Where’s Eddie? He was just here. 
                        STANLEY
            It’s separating us. We need to get 
            help...
They move toward the stairs. But Travis appears at the top. 
He starts to descend. Blood-caked Knife in hand. 
                        TRAVIS
            Baaaa... Baaaa... 
                                                                104.

                        RICHIE
            Guys -- it’s never good when the 
            person with the knife starts making 
            animal noises -- especially when 
            that person is Travis...
Ben turns. Searches for a way out. Finds a Rotted Piece of 
Plywood blocking the bottom of a rusted COAL CHUTE. 
                        BEN
            Here! Climb up!
The Others race over. As Travis steps off the stairs, Mike 
guards the chute with the Stunbolt as the other squeeze 
themselves in and up -- 
                        BEN (CONT’D)
            Mike! Let’s go!
Mike crawls in. But the Others aren’t yet out. 
                        STANLEY
            Shit... Mike... 
                        MIKE
            Just go. Find the others. I’ll hold  
            Travis off...
                        RICHIE
            Mike -- 
                        MIKE
                (re: Stunbolt)
            I came prepared, remember? 
Mike ducks back out of the Chute. And faces his nemesis.

EXT. MACROVERSE - CONTINUOUS
Beverly continues through the thick fog of suffocating 
blackness. Sticks to her like cobwebs. She stops. Sees a 
FLICKERING CAMPFIRE in the distance illuminating -- 
A DECREPIT 19TH-CENTURY CIRCUS WAGON. 
The same we saw in a daguerreotype of the Old Ironworks in 
the Libary. Its peeling billboard promises “PENNYWISE THE 
DANCING CLOWN!” Tattered children’s clothes, toys, and bones 
are scattered all around its small painted wooden wheels.   
From the WELL nearby, she hears -- 
                                                                105.

                        BILL (O.S.)
            HELLO? ANYONE?
                        BEVERLY
            BILL!
She races over to the Well. Looks inside and sees a GLOWING 
ORANGE LIGHT. Its dim but the longer we look, the brighter it 
gets... Beverly tries to back away but -- 
ClankSnap! ClankSnap! Chains WHIP OUT and WRAP around her. 
Holds her there. She can’t look away. Her face goes slack. 
                        PENNYWISE (O.S.)
            Come float with us, Bevvie... 

INT. SEWER - CONTINUOUS
Bill runs through the sewers. Desperate. Up ahead, he hears 
Eddie SCREAMING. He races in the direction of his howls. 
                        BILL
            EDDIE!
Stops at a Derry Public Works MAINTENANCE DOOR. Keep out. 
Bill looks through the small grated window to see -- 
The Hobo wrangling Eddie. His Hand of Disease smothering 
Eddie’s mouth as Eddie hyperventilates. Or tries to. 
                        BILL (CONT’D)
            FIGHT IT, EDS! FIGHT IT!
Seeing Bill, Eddie’s eyes go wide. Like a surge of life just 
rushed through him. He relaxes -- takes a moment -- then -- 
CHOMP! Eddie BITES into the gooey flesh of the Hobo. Stunned, 
Hobo releases and Eddie scrambles to the Door. But he slips 
on the muck and disgusting on his way over. Gets up. 
Finds the Hobo blocking his way out. 
                        HOBO
            You look like you’re coming down 
            with something, Eds... 
Eddie balls his hand into a fist. And then SMASHES it right 
into the Hobo’s stomach. His fist travels through the blood 
and guts until it comes out the other side and -- 
Grabs the knob. Eddie opens the door as he pushes the Hobo 
aside and runs into the 
                                                                106.

SEWER
And collapses into Bill’s arms. He spits out bits of flesh. 
                        EDDIE
            I’m not scared anymore, Bill. I’m 
            really really grossed out but I’m 
            not scared... 

INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
Travis SWIPES at Mike with the Knife. Mike dodges it, but 
slips and falls back. Stunbolt rolls away. 
                        TRAVIS
            I told you to stay the fuck out my 
            town, didn’t I? 
He picks Mike up. Throws him against the wall. Brick chunks 
fall, crashing through termite-infested wood, revealing -- 
The Well.

INT. COAL CHUTE - CONTINUOUS
Stanley, Richie and Ben climb. Flinching as the hear the 
BANGS of the brawl between Mike and Travis.  
At the top of the chute, Stanley pushes open the Access Door. 
Crawls out first, followed by Richie and Stanley. 
They stand, finding themselves in the 
MACROVERSE
                        RICHIE
            What is this place? 
Ben spots something in the distance. The flickering flames of 
a campfire. Illuminating a Circus Wagon. And look, there’s -- 
                        BEN
            -- Beverly!
Yes, Ben. It’s her. Kneeling by the Well. That Orange Glow 
inside getting brighter... Brighter... 
The Boys race over to Beverly. Try to shake her out of the 
trance but it’s no use... 
                                                                107.

                        BEN (CONT’D)
            Beverly -- Hey -- Bev -- it’s me, 
            Ben from Sosh... remember? 
                        RICHIE
            What is she staring at?
He’s about to look inside but Ben stops him. 
                        BEN
            No, don’t. 
                        RICHIE
            Why?
                        BEN
            Cause she looked and... well, look. 
            We need to find something to get 
            her out of these chains... 
Stanley looks over at the Circus Wagon. 
                        STANLEY
            Maybe there’s something in there.
He races over, entering into the 
CIRCUS WAGON
Dusty old carnival show lights flicker on inside, 
illuminating the creepy decaying interior. In the corner, 
Stanley sees a WOOD AX. He moves toward it but -- 
                        VOICE (O.S.)
            Come to float, Stanley?
Stanley stops. Terrified. 
Emerging from the shadows is JUDITH. From the Painting in the 
Rabbi’s Office. Naked. Skin stained red with the blood of 
Holofernes. Like she bathed in it. 
Stanley averts his eyes. 
Paint drips off of her, streaking parts of her into abstract 
deformity. Hinting at a gruesome layer underneath.
                        JUDITH
            Look at me, Stanley. Like you do in 
            your Daddy’s office... 
She wipes her arm across her face, clearing away some of the 
dripping wet paint. Smile smearing into a clownish grin.
                                                                108.

                        JUDITH (CONT’D)
            I can smell your fear, your salted 
            meat... 
She lunges on top of Stanley. He falls, knocking his head 
hard on the floor. Blacks out. Judith about to feed as -- 
Richie rushes in. Doesn’t see Judith. Just Stanley passed out 
on the floor. He goes over -- 
                        RICHIE
            C’mon, Stanley... 
Can’t help but look at his clownish surroundings. Circus 
Posters. Creepy Clown Figurines. Clown Paintings. 
                        RICHIE (CONT’D)
            Not the best place for this, 
            Stan...
A tune begins: 
All around the mulberry bush, the monkey chased the weasel, 
the monkey thought it was all in good sport... 
Richie looks over. Sees a JACK-IN-THE-BOX. A familiar clown 
painted on the side. Its handle slowly turns and -- 
Pop! 
Richie flinches. We all do. But nothing happens. In fact, the 
handle begins to turn again. Song starts over.

INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
Mike. On the floor. Trying to get to his feet. But the pain 
and the fear, it’s starting to get the better of him. 
Ooomf! Travis KICKS him again while he’s down. 

EXT. MACROVERSE - CONTINUOUS
The Orange Glow reflecting off of Beverly’s Face is ever 
brighter. Like it might start to burn her. 
                        BEN
            Please, Bev...

INT. SEWERS - CONTINUOUS
Bill leads Eddie as they run. This way. That way.

                        EDDIE
            Do you know where you’re going? 
An intersection. Bill stops. Unsure. Until he sees at the end 
one tunnel, an ORANGE GLOW dimming the darkness. 
                        BILL
            This way. 
He runs toward the glow. Getting brighter as they get closer.

INT. CIRCUS WAGON - CONTINUOUS
...the monkey thought it was all in good sport... POP! Goes 
the weasel... 
Nothing happens. Again. Richie tries to pull Stanley toward 
the door. But the dead weight, so heavy. 
                        RICHIE
            I don’t want to have to leave you, 
            Stan. C’mon... Help... 

EXT. MACROVERSE - CONTINUOUS
At the door of defeat, Ben hugs Bev. Doesn’t want her to go 
through this alone. And in the first moment of passion in his 
life, he kisses her. Something inside of Beverly -- the light 
of life, maybe -- flickers. 
                        BEVERLY
            Your hair is... January embers... 
                        BEN
            My heart burns there too. 
He squeezes her tighter until it’s broken by -- 
                        BILL (O.S.)
            Beverly! Ben!
They look over as Bill and Richie runs toward them. 

INT. CIRCUS WAGON - CONTINUOUS
...the Monkey chases the weasel... The Monkey thought it was 
all in good fun.... It stops. For an eternity, feels like. 
Richie lets go of Stanley. He might run. And then -- 
PENNYWISE leaps out. 
                                                                110.

                        PENNYWISE
            POP GOES RICHIE!
Richie SCREAMS. 
Pennywise -- as if mounted to a spring -- leans over Richie, 
ready to feed off the fear. Richie too scared to move. 
But as Pennywise gets nose to nose with Richie, his face 
morphs from flesh to the PLASTIC SKIN OF A TOY CLOWN. 
Hands grab Richie. He turns, freaking out. But -- 
                        BILL
            -- it’s us, Rich. It’s us. 
And as Stanley starts coming back to consciousness...

EXT. MACROVERSE - CIRCUS WAGON - CONTINUOUS
...Bill, Eddie and Richie help him out of the wagon. Nearby, 
Ben tries to free Beverly from her chains. 
                        BEN
            Help! I can’t -- C’mon! Hurry!
Richie, Eddie and Stanley rush over to help. But Bill catches 
sight of something running away from them in the distance.
A Small Figure in a Yellow Rain Slicker.
                        BILL
            Georgie!
He takes off. 
                        RICHIE
            No! Bill! Wait!
But Bill doesn’t have time to wait. He races deeper into the 
darkness, chasing after his little brother. 

INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
Mike is on his knees. Wobbly. Travis approaches with the 
Stunbolt in one hand as he drags the Compressed Air Cannister 
along the floor behind him. Travis presses the pistol right 
against Mike’s glabella. You know what that is.
                        TRAVIS
            I’m going to kill you and then I’m 
            going to kill all your friends... 
                                                                111.

Mike looks at Travis. Like he’s given up. But then -- 
                        MIKE
            No. You won’t. 
Mike grabs Travis. Holds him tight as he pulls him back and 
they both disappear down into the Well and we fall with them.
INTO THE WELL
Mike tumbles, like a lost sock. Catches sight of Travis 
falling further below, the Stunbolt beyond him. 
And then he sees it. 
The Perfect Bright Orange Circle below. The Losers -- his 
friends -- surrounding it... 

EXT. MACROVERSE - CONTINUOUS
SPARKS! As Richie snaps the chains around Beverly with the 
Ax. Now free, she stands up and gives Ben a hug -- 
                        BEVERLY
            Thank you... 
CLANK!
They look over as the Stunbolt rolls off the edge of the well 
and stops at Eddie’s feet. 
                        RICHIE
            That’s Mike’s... 
SCREAMING.
As Travis falls from above into the Bright Orange Lights. 
Falling fast behind him is Mike. He hits the edge of --
THE WELL
Ouch. Grabs it. But slipping fast. 
Beverly dives over and grabs onto him to help. The Others all 
join in and start to pull Mike to safety as -- 
Skitter... skitter... skitter... 
Up the side of the wall, a Melted Mess of Hands appear. Grab 
onto Mike’s ankle. Pulling him down into the Dead Lights. 
Afraid, Mike tries to kick ‘em off. But he’s losing the 
battle. Gathers his strength. And courage. 
                                                                112.

                        MIKE
            Let! Me! Go!
Punctuates each word with a kick. And with the final one, the 
hardest one, the hands fall away. Mike is free. 
And is pulled to safety. But the safety is fleeting as the 
ground under their feet TREMORS. Like it’s the start of 
something big...
                        BEVERLY
            We have to find Bill. 

EXT. MACROVERSE - THE DARKNESS - CONTINUOUS
Bill stops. Looks that way. No Georgie. This way. Uh-uh. 
                        BILL
            GEORGIE!
He squints. Sees something approach. Coming at him fast. Is 
it...? Is that Geo-- 
PENNYWISE. 
Like freight train at full speed, charges into Bill and picks 
him up by his collar. Shoves him against a wall that only 
just now appeared behind him. 
Pennywise. Bill. Face. To Freakish, Fanged Face. 
                        PENNYWISE
            A feast for Pennywise. Ripe fear, 
            raw fright, a belly full of blood-
            dripping dread. Can you smell tasty 
            Georgie on my b-b-breath, B-B-Bill? 
            I bit down on his windpipe as his 
            last word was uttered... ‘Billy’, 
            he whimpered, ‘Billy’ he wanted, 
            Pennywise he feared and Pennywise I 
            fed. I still pick his little boy 
            meat from my teeth... 
Flecks of flesh hit Bill in the face as he says this. 
                        PENNYWISE (CONT’D)
            Now I grow hungry again. 
                        BILL
            Y-You’re going to stay hungry. 
            We’re not scared of you anymore. 
            None us of are. We’re going to make 
            your worst fear come tr-true...
                                                                113.

In the blackness, they hear the Losers’ calling out for Bill. 
The Tremors find their way to Bill and Pennywise. Confused, 
Pennywise looks down at the ground. What’s happening? He 
looks back up at Bill. 
                        BILL (CONT’D)
            You’re going to starve. 
ON PENNYWISE. That word. Starve. It lights a spark in his 
eyes we haven’t seen before as it resonates in the ancestral 
cave of his mind like a chain reaction in a firework factory. 
Belief has turned against him. And probably for the first 
time in millenniums, it grips his heart. Whatever that is. 
Pennywise drops Bill. 
And retreats into the darkness. 
                                                           CUT TO:
THE OTHER LOSERS. In the darkness. Holding their torches 
high, searching for their leader. 
                        STANLEY
            Bill! BILL!
Up ahead, 
                        BILL (O.S.)
            OVER HERE!
They run, shouting. Tremors turn to QUAKES. It’s like the 
whole universe is about to collapse around them.
                        BEVERLY
            BILL!
There. Up ahead. On his knees. She helps him to his feet.
                        BEVERLY (CONT’D)
            Are you okay? 
Bill nods. Even though he isn’t. 
                        BILL
            H-He took off. We need to find and 
            kill It. It won’t stop until we do.
Bill grabs the Stunbolt from Mike and heads off into the 
QUAKING DARKNESS 
The Losers hunt Pennywise. With every encounter, It takes on 
one of their Fears. Headless Child. Judith. Hand Creature.
                                                                114.

And each Loser steps up and confront It.
Throwing their torches at It -- letting go of their Fears -- 
causing It to retreat into the blackness. Until only Bill’s 
Torch remains. In its flickering light, they catch the 
faintest glimpses of Pennywise. 
Circling around them.
                        PENNYWISE (O.S.)
            A truce to be true. A deal to be 
            struck. Ignore this, forget me, and 
            I will let you all grow and thrive, 
            living happy lives until you die 
            happy deaths at age hundred and 
            one... 
                        BILL
            NO! No more... 
Psssh! Bill’s TORCH extinguishes. Leaving the Losers huddled 
in the darkness. 
                        RICHIE
            Maybe we should have at least 
            discussed the deal first...  
THIN SHAFTS OF LIGHT appear. Like the sun shining through a 
sewer grate, almost heavenly as they illuminate -- 
Georgie. In his rain slicker. Holding his Paper Boat. 
                        GEORGIE
            Let him go, Bill. He said I could 
            come back if you let him go... 
            Please, Bill... 
Bill hesitates. 
                        GEORGIE (CONT’D)
            It’s really me, Bill. It’s Georgie. 
            He kept me here... You can take me 
            home... You can save me... 
Bill unsure. So badly wants to believe. 
                        BEVERLY (O.S.)
            Bill.
He turns. Sees Beverly. With the rest of the Losers. He faces 
back to Georgie. Holding his arms out to Bill: Hug me...
                                                                115.

                        BILL
            I want you back more than anything 
            else... 
Bill takes a step forward to Georgie. And he raises his arms. 
But not too hug him because he has in his hands -- 
The Stunbolt.
                        BILL (CONT’D)
            But you’re not Georgie... 
Georgie turns to -- 
Pennywise. Razor teeth. Ready to lunge. 
BLAM!
Stunbolt goes off. 
Hits Pennywise right between the eyes. 
His face RIPPLES, like a rock hitting the surface of a lake.  
A CONCENTRICAL NIGHTMARE with petals of HORROR that BLOSSOM 
then WITHER away. The history of Derry’s Fears flash and form 
before their eyes, a thousand nightmares conjured by the 
imaginations of Derry’s lost and eaten children. IT is wreath 
of Screaming Hands. IT is the Rotting Flesh of Disease. IT is 
the Fangs of a Predator. IT is a Crown of Bloody Thorns. IT 
is the Floral Ring at Georgie’s Memorial soaked in blood. IT 
is a Mouth That Screams Inside a Mouth That Screams Inside a 
Mouth That Screams Inside.... IT is... IT is... IT is... 
Until IT transforms back into a slithering, shapeless mass 
and slinks its way back to the Well. 
The Losers chase. 
And as It disappears down to the bottom, we catch one last 
glimpse of Pennywise’s Face. And he looks afraid. As the 
Darkness brightens...
It isn’t. 
And the Losers find themselves in the 
BASEMENT
The seven of them. 
Together. 
In the corner of the basement, Bill spots a dirty, wet patch 
of YELLOW. He walks over and pulls at it, revealing -- 
                                                                116.

Georgie’s Rain Slicker. 
Bill falls to his knees and starts to cry. Months of pent up 
anger and grief, he lets it all out. The Other Losers walk 
over and surround him, a circle of love and friendship.

EXT. THE BARRENS - DAY 
Bodies of children disgorge from the sewer pipe the Losers’ 
found Dorsey’s shoe in, into a swollen stream. It’s hard at 
first to distinguish who is who, everyone is covered in mud.
Among them, a body blinks and sits up. It’s Travis.

TITLE CARD:
              SEPTEMBER

EXT. RIVERBANK - DUSK
A GLASS SHARD glistens in the sun. A hand picks it up. 
Beverly’s. She walks back to the group. 
                        BEVERLY
            Swear it, guys. Swear if IT isn’t 
            dead we’ll all come back.. 
She hands the SHARD to Bill, who SLASHES her PALM with it. 
One by one the others approach, Bill slashing everyone’s 
palms, does his own last before -- 
They all clasp hands and lock eyes. 
A BLOOD OATH IS SWORN.

INT. BILL’S BEDROOM - DAY
Bill finishes up packing. Zach pops his head in.
                        ZACH
            Almost ready, champ?
Bill nods. 
                        ZACH (CONT’D)
            You were right.
                                                                117.

Zach throws down a paper on Bill’s bed. Travis and his dad 
under the caption “SON ADMITS MURDERS, SAYS MY DADDY MADE ME 
DO IT.”
                        ZACH (CONT’D)
            I’m proud of you son.
He goes. Bill looks at the ceiling, water stain now gone.  
Still uneasy.

EXT. WILL’S HOUSE - DAY
Bill packs his suitcase and looks out for his friends, 
someone to send him off.  No one.  His mom closes the truck 
and kisses him on the forehead.  Still distant, but trying.
                        SHARON
            I know it’s not Acadia, but maybe 
            we can make new memories.  Just us.
                        BILL
            It’s cool, Ma.

INT. BILL’S WAGONER - MOVING - DAY
They pull out and Bill looks ahead, now wishing he could stay 
with his friends.  As they pass Witcham and Jackson Bill 
glances out at the infamous storm drain. 
Then he notices behind him one, two, three, four, five, six 
HUFFY BIKES swing out into the road, chasing him.  Ben, Bev, 
Richie, Mike, Stanley and Eddie all peddle like mad after him 
waving goodbye.
Bill waves goodbye and puts his hand against the glass as 
they drive away, the swarm of bikes trying to keep up behind, 
until finally, turning a corner...
His friends are gone from sight.

EXT. DERRY/SKY OVER IT - DAY
As Bill’s wagon drives off we RISE UP UP UP over Bill’s 
neighborhood, then HIGH OVER DERRY and the rivers and all 
black pines as far as the eye can see, until we come to...
A floating RED BALLOON
It POPS!
                               The End
118.
